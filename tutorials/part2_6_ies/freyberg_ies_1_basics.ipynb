    "# PESTPP-IES - History Matching For \"Nothing\", Uncertainty Analysis for Free\n",
    "\n",
    "PESTPP-IES embodies an approach to data assimilation and uncertainty analysis which is a signifcant departure from the “calibrate first and do uncertainty analysis later”. PESTPP-IES does away with the search for a \"unique\" parameter field that calibrates a model. Instead, its goal is to obtain an _ensemble_ of parameter fields, all of which adequately reflect measured data and expert knowledge. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike PESTPP-GLM and PEST(\\_HP), PESTPP-IES does not calculate derivatives using finite parameter differences. Instead, it calculates approximate partial derivatives from cross-covariances between parameter values and model outputs that are calculated using members of the ensemble. A major benefit that is forthcoming from this approach to calculating partial derivatives is that the number of model runs required to history-match an ensemble is independent of the number of adjustable parameters. This means that it is feasible for a model to employ a large number of adjustable parameters (history matching for \"nothing\"...). Conceptually, this reduces propensity for predictive bias at the same time as it protects against uncertainties of decision-critical model predictions being underestimated. \n",
    "\n",
    "PESTPP-IES commences by using a suite of random parameter fields sampled from the prior parameter probability distribution. Each parameter field is referred to as a “realisation”. The suite of realisations is referred to as an “ensemble”. Using an iterative procedure, PESTPP-IES modifies the parameters that comprise each realisation so that each is better able to better reflect historical data. In other words, PESTPP-IES adjusts the parameters of each realisation in order to reduce the misfit between simulated and measured observation values. \n",
    "\n",
    "But there is more! PESTPP-IES also accounts for the influence of observation noise. Each parameter realisation is (optionaly) adjusted to fit a slightly different set of observation values. (An observation ensemble can be provided by the user or generated automatically by PESTPP-IES.) Thus, the uncertainty incurred through observation noise gets carried through to the predictions' posterior uncertainty. \n",
    "\n",
    "The outcome of this multi-realisation parameter adjustment process is an ensemble of parameter fields, all of which allow the model to adequately replicate observed system behaviour. These parameter fields can be considered samples of the posterior parameter probability distribution. By simulating a forecast with this ensemble of models, a sample of the _posterior forecast probability distribution_ is obtained (uncertainty analysis for free...). \n"

In practice, the number of realisations is limited by computing resources (more realisations require more model runs per iteration). \n",

This ensures that the iterative ensemble smoother has access to the directions in parameter space that it requires in order to provide a good fit with the calibration dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, this number can only be guessed. It is usually less than the number of observations comprising a calibration dataset, and can never be greater than this. Furthermore, the dimensionality of the solution space decreases with the amount of noise that accompanies the dataset. If a Jacobian matrix is available (it may remain from a previous calibration exercise), the pyEMU (or the SUPCALC utility from the PEST suite) can be used to assess solution space dimensionality. "

Conceptually, each parameter realization in the prior ensemble is paired with a realization of observed values plus measurement noise.  This means that each parameter realization is seeking to match a (slightly) different set of observed values.  This is the reason pestpp-ies report a \"measured\" objective function summary and an \"actual\" objective function summary; the former includes the noise realizations, the latter does not.\n",

Users can also supply a ready-made observation ensemble by specifying a file name in the `ies_observation_ensemble()` PEST++ control variable . Let's do that.

    "### Other options that are usually a good idea\n",
    "\n",
    "PESTPP-IES has heaps of options that can be brought to bare for any given problem but most of these have good default values.  However, two options that can be very important for highly nonlinear inverse problems are related to how and when to give up on realizations that are just not doing very well with respect to phi.  These lagging realizations can dominate the obective function and therefore influence the choice of lambda values, and, ultimately, the success of the PESTPP-IES analysis. These two options are `ies_bad_phi` and `ies_bad_phi_sigma`.  The first one, `ies_bad_phi` is an absolute tolerance on the maximum phi value that will be allowed for any realization in the ensemble at any point in the algorithm.  If a realization yields a phi greater than `ies_bad_phi`, it will be \"dropped\" from the ensemble.  This can be an important option if cells go dry and yield an enormous phi.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The second option, `ies_bad_phi_sigma` is a relative tolerance on the phi of a realization vs the mean phi of all the realizations in the ensemble.  The \"sigma\" tells us standard deviation is involved in this option:  `ies_bad_phi_sigma` is the standard deviation \"distance\" from the mean phi that realizations are allowed to have before they are dropped.  For example, if the mean phi is 100 and standard deviation around this mean is 20, and `ies_bad_phi_sigma` = 2, then any realization with a phi greater than 100 + (2 * 20) = 140 is dropped.  This \"adaptive\" rejection filter adapts as the ensemble evolves across iterations, and, for highly nonlinear problems, this option can make a huge difference.  Values between 1.5 (more agressive) and 2.5 (more tolerant) seem to work well..."
