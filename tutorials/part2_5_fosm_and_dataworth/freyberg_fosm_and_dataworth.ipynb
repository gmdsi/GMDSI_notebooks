    "# FOSM, Data Worth and Related Assessments\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear uncertainty analysis is also known as “first order second moment” (or FOSM) analysis. It provides approximate mathematical characterisation of prior predictive probability distributions, and of posterior parameter and predictive probability distributions. It has other uses as well. It can be used to demonstrate how the history-matching process bestows worth on data. It can also be deployed to track the flow of information from field measurements of system state to parameters, and ultimately from parameters to model predictions. It does all of these things by implementing Bayes equation under the following assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    " - \tThe prior probability distribution of parameters is multiGaussian. \n",
    " - \t“Measurement noise” (including structural noise) is also characterized by a Gaussian probability distribution. \n",
    " - \tThe relationships between model outputs that correspond to measurements of system state and parameters employed by a model can be approximated by the action of a matrix on a vector.\n",
    " - \tModel outputs that correspond to predictions of management interest can be calculated using another matrix that acts on model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, linear analysis is undertaken after a model has been calibrated. However, if a model is truly linear (which it never is), the outcomes of linear analysis are independent of parameter values; they can therefore, in theory, be applied with a model that is endowed with user-supplied prior mean parameter values. \n",
    "\n",
    "If a model has undergone calibration, then minimum-error variance (i.e. calibrated) parameter values should be assigned to parameters as their initial values in the “parameter data” section of the PEST control file on which linear analysis is based. The Jacobian matrix should be calculated using these parameters. If the uncertainty of a prediction is being examined, then the model output that pertains to this prediction must be included as a (zero-weighted) “observation” in the PEST input dataset; sensitivities of this model output to model parameters will therefore appear in the Jacobian matrix. Alternatively, a separate prediction-only Jacobian matrix can be built based on a PEST control file that is dedicated to this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "FOSM tasks may include:\n",
    " - approximate parameter and predictive uncertainty quantification;\n",
    " - data worth analysis;\n",
    " - identifying parameters that are most salient for forecasts of interest, \n",
    " - identifying parameter contributions to predictive uncertainty and \n",
    " - assessing parameter identifiability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Outcomes of these analyses can provide easily understood insights into what history-matching can and cannot achieve with the available information. These insights can be used to streamline the data assimlation process and guide further site characterisation studies. Of particular interest is data worth analysis. The worth of data is measured by their ability to reduce the uncertainties of model predictions that we care about. Because the equations on which FOSM relies do not require that an observation value already be known, data worth can be assessed on as-of-yet ungathered data. \n"

    "### The current tutorial\n",
    " \n",
    "In this notebook, we will use outputs from previous notebooks (in particular `freyberg_glm_1.ipynb`) to eply first-order second-moment (FOSM) techniques to assess the flow of information from data to parameters and forecasts. In doing so we will asses the worth of existing and potential new data. \"Worth\" is framed here in the context of the extent to which the uncertainty surrounding a model prediction of management interest is reduced.  Given that these anayses can help target and optimize data acquisition strategies, this is a concept that really resonates with decision makers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in this tutorial, we will demonstrate FOSM applied __before__ calibration (i.e. as an optional intermediate step between the `freyberg_glm_1.ipynb` and `freyberg_glm_2.ipynb` notebooks), as several of these techniques can be a usefull tools that aid in the design of the calibration setup. However, they are equaly applicable __after__ calibration. In the `freyberg_glm_2.ipynb` notebook, some outcomes of post-calibration FOSM are discussed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will be using functionality in `pyemu` to undertake FOSM. Similar analyses can be undertaken with the PREDUNC and PREDVAR suite of PEST utilities (see the [GMDSI](https://gmdsi.org/education/tutorials/) website for tutorials on these utilities). "
