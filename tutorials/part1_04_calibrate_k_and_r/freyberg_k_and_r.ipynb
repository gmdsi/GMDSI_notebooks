    "# History Match Freyberg using K and Recharge\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook continues where the `freyberg_k.ipynb` notebook left off. In the previous notebook we calibrated the Freyberg model by adjusting a single parameter - `hk`. We were able to obtain excellent fits with measured heads, and _apparently_ forecast uncertainties were very very low. This was of course __wrong__, as we will see over the course of the next few tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we introduce the concepts of non-uniqueness and parameter correlation. We will repeat the same calibration and uncertainty analysis but with two adjustable parameters - hydraulic conductivity (`hk`) and recharge (`rch0`). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous tutorial, recharge parameters were fixed. Remember that when a parameter is fixed (e.g. not adjustable during calibration or uncertainty analysis), this implies that it is perfectly known. Rarely, if ever, is a parameter value perfectly known. Recharge in particular. Recharge is hard to measure in the field and difficult to upscale to a model domain. It is never perfectly known and should be included in the parameter estimation process. Let's get to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Admin\n",
    "We have provided some pre-cooked PEST dataset files, wrapped around the modified Freyberg model. This is the same dataset introduced in the \"freyberg_pest_setup\" and \"freyberg_k\" notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "The functions in the next cell import required dependencies and prepare a folder for you. This folder contains the model files and a preliminary PEST setup. Run the cells, then inspect the new folder named \"freyberg_mf6\" which has been created in your tutorial directory. (Just press `shift+enter` to run the cells). "
