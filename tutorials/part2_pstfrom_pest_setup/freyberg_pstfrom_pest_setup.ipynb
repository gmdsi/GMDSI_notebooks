    "# Setup the PEST(++) interface around the modified Freyberg model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will construct a complex model independent (non-intrusive) interface around an existing `MODFLOW6` model using `pyEMU`. We assume that the reader is at least partially familiar with PEST(++) file formats and working philosophy. \n",
    "\n",
    "The modified Freyberg groundwater flow model has been constructed and is described in a previous notebook from this series. We will construct the entire PEST(++) interface from scratch here. This setup will be built upon in subsequent tutorials. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will rely heavily on the `pyemu.PstFrom` class. Although here we employ it with a `MODFLOW6` model, `PstFrom` is designed to be general and software independent (mostly). Some features are only available for `MODFLOW` models (e.g. `SpatialReference`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PstFrom` class automates the construction of high-dimensional PEST(++) interfaces with all the bells and whistles. It provides easy-to-use functions to process model input and output files into PEST(++) datasets. It can assist with setting up spatio-temporaly varying parameters. It handles the generation of geostatisical prior covariance matrices and ensembles. It automates writting a \"model run\" script. It provides tools to add custom pre- and post-processing functions to this script. It makes adding tweaks and fixes to the PEST(++) interface a breeze. All of this from the comfort of your favourite Python IDE.\n",
    "\n",
    "During this tutorial we are going to construct a PEST dataset. Amongst other things, we will demonstrate:\n",
    " - how to add observations & parameters from model output & input files;\n",
    " - how to add pre- and post-processing functions to the \"model run\" script;\n",
    " - how to generate geostatistical structures for spatialy and temporally correlated parameters;\n",

    "The `PstFrom.add_parameters()` method reads model input files and adds parameters to the PEST(++) dataset. Parameterisation can be configured in several ways. \n",
    "\n",
    " - model input files can be in array or list format;\n",
    " - parameters can be setup as different \"types\". Each value in model input files can (1) each be a separate parameter (\"grid\" scale parameters), (2) be grouped into \"zones\" or (3) all be treated as a single parameter (\"constant\" type). Alteratvely, (4) parameters can be assigned to pilot points, from which individual parameter values are subsequently interpolated. `PstFrom` adds the relevant pre-processing steps to assign paramter values directly into the \"model run\" script.\n",
    " - parameter values can be setup as \"direct\", \"multiplier\" or \"addend\". This means the \"parameter value\" which PEST(++) sees can be (1) the same value the model sees, (2) a multiplier on the value in the existing/original model input file, or (3) a value which is added to the value in the existing/original model input file. This is very nifty and allows for some pretty advanced parameterization schemes by allowing mixtures of different types of parameters. `PstFrom` is designed to preferentially use parameters setup as multipliers (that is the default parameter type). This let us preserve the existing model inputs and treat them as the mean of the prior parameter distribution. Once again, relevant pre-processing scripts are automatically added to the \"model run\" script (discussed later) so that the multiplicative and additive parameterization process is not something the user has to worry about.\n",

    "As discussed, all model inputs are stored in external files. Some are arrays. Others are lists. Recall that our model has 3 layers. It is transient. Hydraulic properties (Kh, Kv, Ss, Sy) vary in space. Recharge varies over both space and time. We have GHBs, SFR and WEL boundary conditions. GHB parameters are constant over time, but vary spatially. SFR inflow varies over time. Pumping rates of individual wells are uncertain in space and and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these have some degree of spatial and/or temporal correlation.\n",

    "#### 5.2. Geostatistical Structures\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter correlation plays a role in (1) regularization when giving preference to the emergence of patterns of spatial heterogeneity and (2) when specifying the prior parameter probability distribution (which is what regularization is enforcing!). Since we are all sophisticated and recognize the importance of expressing spatial and temporal uncertainty (e.g. heterogeneity) in the model inputs (and the corresponding spatial correlation in those uncertain inputs), let's use geostatistics to express uncertainty. To do that we need to define \"geostatistical structures\". \n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of this tutorial, let's assume that heterogeneity in all spatially distributed parameters share the same statistical characteristics. Likewise for temporally varying parameters. We will therefore only  construct two geostatisitcal structures."

And, while we are at it, lets also extract the global water budget info from the MF6 listing file and store it in dataframes - these are ususally good numbers to watch!  We will need the simulated water level arrays later for sequential data assimilation (wouldnt it be nice if MF6 supported the writing of ASCII format head arrays?).

These can be important components in a history-matching dataset to tease out specific aspects of system behaviour (e.g. head differences between aquifer layers to inform vertical permeabilities).

These new files contain (1) the temporal-differences between head and SFR observations, and (2) the difference in heads between the top and bottom layers at each observation point. The new .csv files are named `heads.tdiff.csv`,`sfr.tdiff.csv` and `heads.vdiff.csv` respectively.\n",
