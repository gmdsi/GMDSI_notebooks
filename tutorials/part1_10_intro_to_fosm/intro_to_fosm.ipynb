    "FOSM stands for \"First Order, Second Moment\", which is the mathematical description of what is being described. In PEST documentation (and other GMDSI tutorials), it is sometimes referred to as \"linear analysis\". See also page 460 in [Anderson et al.

    "FOSM provides approximate mathematical characterisation of prior predictive probability distributions, and of posterior parameter and predictive probability distributions. It has other uses as well. It can be used to demonstrate how the history-matching process bestows worth on data. It can also be deployed to track the flow of information from field measurements of system state to parameters, and ultimately from parameters to model predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "It does all of these things by implementing Bayes equation under the following assumptions:\n",
    " -  The prior probability distribution of parameters is multiGaussian.\n",
    " - “Measurement noise” (including structural noise) is also characterized by a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    " - The relationships between model outputs that correspond to measurements of system state and parameters employed by a model can be approximated by the action of a matrix on a vector.\n",
    " - Model outputs that correspond to predictions of management interest can be calculated using another matrix that acts on model parameters.\n",
    " \n",
    "Ideally linear analysis is undertaken after a model has been calibrated. However, if a model is truly linear (which it never is), the outcomes of FOSM are independent of parameter values and can therefore, in theory, be applied with the user-supplied prior mean parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "If calibration has been undertaken, then minimum-error variance (i.e. calibrated) parameter values should be assigned to parameters as their initial parameters in the “parameter data” section of the PEST control file on which linear analysis is based. The Jacobian matrix should be calculated using these parameters. And, if the uncertainty of a prediction is going to be examined, then the model output that pertains to this prediction must be included as an “observation” in the PEST input dataset; sensitivities of this model output to model parameters will therefore appear in the Jacobian matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "FOSM tasks may include:\n",
    " - approximate parameter and predictive uncertainty quantification;\n",
    " - data worth analysis;\n",
    " - identifying parameters that are most salient for forecasts of interest, \n",
    " - identifying parameter contributions to predictive uncertainty and \n",
    " - assessing parameter identifiability. \n",
    "\n",
    "Outcomes of these analyses can provide easily understood insights into what history-matching can and cannot achieve with the available information. These insights can be used to streamline the data assimlation process and guide further site characterisation studies. Of particular interest is data worth analysis. The worth of data is measured by their ability to reduce the uncertainties of model predictions that we care about. Because the equations on which FOSM relies do not require that an observation value already be known, data worth can be assessed on as-of-yet ungathered data. \n",
