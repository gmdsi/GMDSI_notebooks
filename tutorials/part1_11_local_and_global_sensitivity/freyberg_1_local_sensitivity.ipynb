    "# Local Parameter Sensitivity and Identifiability\n",

    "Sensitivity analysis maks use of a Jacobian matrix to determine statistical insights into a model. We have already discussed the Jacobian matrix in a few places. It is calculated by perturbing the parameter (usually 1%) and tracking what happens to each observation.  In a general form the sensitivity equation looks like eq. 9.7 Anderson et al. 2015:\n",

    "### Parameter Sensitivty\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that a Jacobian matrix stores parameter-to-observation sensitivities.  For each parameter-observation combination, we can see how much the observation value changes due to a small change in the parameter. If $y$ are the observations and $x$ are the parameters, the equation for the $i^th$ observation with respect to the $j^th$ parameter is:  \n",

    "### Parameter Identifiability\n",
    "Sensitivity analyses can mask other artifacts that affect calibration and uncertainty. A primary issues is correlation between parameters.  For example, we saw that in a heads-only calibration we can't estimate both recharge and hydraulic conductivity independently - the parameters are correlated so that an increase in one can be offset with an increase in the other.  To address this shortcoming, Doherty and Hunt (2009) show that singular value decomposition can extend the sensitivity insight into __*parameter identifiability*__.  Parameter identifiability combines parameter insensitivity and correlation information, and reflects the robustness with which particular parameter values in a model might be calibrated. That is, an identifiable parameter is both sensitive and relatively uncorrelated and thus is more likely to be estimated (identified) than an insensitive and/or correlated parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter identifiability is considered a \"linear method\" in that it assumes the Jacobian matrix sensitivities hold over a range of reasonable parameter values.  It is able to address parameter correlation through singular value decomposition (SVD), exactly as we've seen earlier in this course.  Parameter identifiability ranges from 0 (perfectly unidentifiable with the observations available) to 1.0 (fully identifiable). So, we typically plot identifiability using a stacked bar chart which is comprised of the included singular value contributions. Another way to think of it: if a parameter is strongly in the SVD solution space (low singular value so above the cutoff) it will have a higher identifiability. However, as Doherty and Hunt (2009) point out, identifiability is qualitative in nature because the singular value cutoff is user specified.  "

    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "As has been mentioned a couple of times now, sensitivity and identifiability assumes that the relation between parameter and obsevration changes are linear. These sensitivities are tested for a single parameter set (i.e. the parameter values listed in the PEST control file). This parameter set can be before or after calibration (or any where in between). The undelying assumption is that the linear relation holds. \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this is rarely the case. Thus, sensitivities obtained during derivative-based parameter estimation is ___local___. It only holds up in the vicinity of the current parameters. That being said, it is a quick and computationaly efficient method to gain insight into the model and links between parameters and simualted outputs. \n",

    "An alternative is to employ _global_ sensitivity analysis methods, which we introduce in a subsequent notebook.\n",

Well if we have a very long-running model and many adjstable parameters - _and if we really need to use derivative-based parameter estimation methods (i.e. PEST++GLM)_ - we could now identify parameters that can be fixed and/or omitted during parameter estimation (but not uncertainty analysis!). \n",

    "Looking at forecast-to-parameter sensitivities can also inform us of which parameters matter for our forecast. If a parameter doesn't affect a forecast, then we are less concerned with it. If it does...then we may wish to give it more attention. These methods provide usefull tools for assessing details of model construction and their impact on decision-support forecasts of interest (e.g. assessing whether a boundary condition affects a forecast).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But! As has been mentioned - these methods are _local_ and assume a linear relation between parameter and observation changes. As we have seen, this is usualy not the case. A more robust measure of parameter sensitivity requires the use of global sensitivity analysis methods, discussed in the next tutorial."
