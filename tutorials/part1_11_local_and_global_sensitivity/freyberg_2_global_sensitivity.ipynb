    "# Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA)\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity methods we've looked at so far only evaluate the \"local\" sensitivity at a single set of parameter values.  For example, the Jacobian matrix represents perturbations to a single set of parameter values.  This local view can be a problem in cases when our inverse problem is nonlinear (i.e. most cases), which means the parameter sensitivities can change depending on what the parameter value is. \n",
    "\n",
    "### What if we looked at more than one set of parameter values?\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, Global Sensitivity Analyses are statistical approaches that characterize how model parameters affect model outputs over a __wide range__ of acceptable parameter values. GSA aims for greater robustness and information provision than local sensitivity analysis based on partial derivatives of model outputs with respect to model parameters. Because local sensitivity analysis is limited to a single point in parameter space, the information it produces is frequently insufficient to support an understanding of the behaviour of nonlinear models whose outputs depend on complicated and parameter-value-dependent combinations of model parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some GSA methods provide general information about the variability of the sensitivities and have relatively low computational requirements, whereas others provide detailed information on nonlinear behavior and interactions between parameters at the expense of larger computational requirements. For a complete introduction to GSA theory and methods, see [Saltelli et al (2004)](http://www.andreasaltelli.eu/file/repository/SALTELLI_2004_Sensitivity_Analysis_in_Practice.pdf) and [Saltelli et al (2008)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9780470725184).\n",

    "[Saltelli et al (2004)](http://www.andreasaltelli.eu/file/repository/SALTELLI_2004_Sensitivity_Analysis_in_Practice.pdf) provide an overview of the \"settings\" in which sensitivity analysis can be usefully employed. Of these, in an environmental modelling context the following are highlighted:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identifying non-influencial parameters (also known as \"screening\") is usefull in the process of simplifying complex models (or parameterisation schemes). Non-influencial parameters are those that do not influence the model output of interest (whether it be a forecast or the measurment objective function). These are parameters which can be fixed at any given value, without signifincatly influencing the output of interest. If necessary, they can be omitted from model design or parameter estimation, in an effort to reduce computational burden.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Identifying parameters, and the interactions between parameters, which are important for a forecast of interest. This is perhaps one of the most common uses of sensitivity analysis. Assuming that all uncertain parameters are susceptible to determination (at the same cost per parameter). A sensitivity analysis can aid in idnetifying the parameter that is most deserving of better experimental measurement in order to reduce the forecast uncertainty the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mapping parameter-to-output response. Often decision-support modelling is interested in avoiding an undesired outcome for some forecast of interest. Sensitivity analysis can be employed to assess which parameters (or parameter combinations) are most responsible for producing output in the region of interest. In other words, which parameter (and parameter values) are most likely to result in a \"bad thing\" happening? This can become usefull in a hypothesis-testing workflow.\n"

    "\n",
    "[PEST++SEN](https://github.com/usgs/pestpp/blob/master/documentation/pestpp_users_manual.md#7-pestpp-sen) currently supports two GSA meth­ods. These are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - the __Method of Morris__ (Morris, 1991), with extensions proposed by Campolongo et al (2005), and\n",
    " - the __Method of Sobol__ (Sobol, 2001).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we'll focus on the __Method of Morris__ because it is computationally more efficient. But this efficiency comes with a tradeoff: the Method of Morris only provides estimates of the _mean_ and _variance_ of the sensitivity distribution for each parameter. Because of the lack of complete description of the parameter nonlinearity and interactions between parameters, the Method of Morris can be used as a _screening-level_ tool to identify the most important parameters for the observations tested. This screening can be followed by application of a more comprehensive tool, such as the Method of Sobol, which further characterizes the effects of parameter nonlinearity and inter-parameter interactions. \n"

    "### Method of Morris\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in Saltelli et all (2004), the guiding philosophy of the Morris method is to determine which parameters may be considered to have effects which are (a) negligible, (b) linear and additive, or (c) non-linear or correlated with other parameters. The experimental plan proposed by Morris is composed of individually randomised 'one-at-a-time' experiments; the impact of changing one factor at a time is evaluated in turn. The Method of Morris is referred to as a “one-at-a-time” method because each parameter is perturbed sequentially to compute sensitivities - making it ideally suited for parallel computing. \n",
    "\n",
    "> Many parameters evaluated = lots of computer time. Luckily we can use [PEST++SEN](https://github.com/usgs/pestpp/blob/master/documentation/pestpp_users_manual.md#7-pestpp-sen) to run GSA in parallel. \n",
    "\n",
    "The method samples the sensitivity of a given parameter at several locations over the range of reasonable parameter space (__defined by the parameter bounds in the PEST Control file__) and then provides two measures of parameter sensitivity: the mean (__μ__) and the standard deviation (__σ__) of the resulting sensitivity distribution. The mean, __μ__, captures the overall effect of a parameter on the model output of interest; the standard deviation, __σ__, measures a parameter’s sensitivity across the range of acceptable parameter values, this being an indicator of how nonlinear a given parameter is and (or) how the parameter interacts with other parameters. It is important to note that the Method of Morris __cannot distinguish__ between parameter nonlinearity and parameter interactions because only the standard deviation of parameter sensitivity is available. \n",
