    "The runs so far were intended to be greatly oversimplified so as to be a starting point for adding complexity. However, when we added just __*one more parameter*__ for a total of 2 parameters uncertainty for some forecasts got appreciably __worse__.  And these parameters cover the entire model domain, which is unrealistic for the natural world!  Are we past the \"sweetspot\" and should avoid any additional complexity even if our model looks nothing like reality?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Adding parameters in and of itself is not the real problem.  Rather, it is adding parameters that influence forecasts but which are unconstrained by observations so that they are free to wiggle and ripple uncertainty to our forcasts.  If observations are added that help constrain the parameters, the forecast observation will be more certain. That is, the natural flip side of adding parameters is constraining them, with data (first line of defense) or soft-knowledge and problem dimension reduciton (SVD).  \n",
