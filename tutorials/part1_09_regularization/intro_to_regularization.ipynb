The mathematical term for the process through which a unique solution is sought for a nonunique inverse problem is “regularization”. The goal of regularised inversion is to seek a unique parameter field that results in a suitable fit between model outputs and field measurements, whilst minimizing the potential for wrongness in model predictions. That is, out of all the ways to fit a calibration dataset, regularized inversion seeks the parameter set of minimum error variance.\n",

We constrain them observations as we have seen so far, but we also know things about the system that are not hard data like measurements.  This \"soft-knowledge\" can also be applied to  constrain our parameters through a mechanism called __\"Tikhonov regularization\"__.  In this formulation of the inverse problem, we add a second term to our \"best fit\" metric Phi.

    "\n",
    "PEST(++) provides a user with a great deal of flexibility in how Tikhonov constraints can be introduced to an inversion process. The easiest way is to do this is through the use of prior information equations. When prior information equations are employed, Tikhonov constraints are expressed through preferred values that are assigned to linear relationships between parameters. (Equality is the simplest type of linear relationship.) Weights must be assigned to these equations. As is described in PEST documentation, when PEST is run in “regularization” mode, it makes internal adjustments to the weights that are assigned to any observations or prior information equations that belong to special observation groups that are referred to as “regularization groups”. \n",

    "1. *preferred  value* - \"I believe this Kh parameter is around 1 m/d\"\n",

    "\n",
    "One of the most useful preferred condition for collapsing all these parameters to fewer bins is a special case of preferred difference where the difference = 0.  This is often called: __\"preferred homogeneity\"__ -  which equates to something along the lines of \"I believe this area has homogeneous Kh\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Of these, __preferred value__ is the easiest implement, and least memory intensive, preferred condition.   `pyemu` implements this with functionality called \"*__zero_order_tikhonov__*\". (Make sure the initial values in the control file represent your soft-knowledge!) `pyemu` also has preferred difference available - look for *\"__first_order_pearson_tikhonov__\"*.  We'll see both of these in this notebook. We will demosntrate these functions further on."

    "Tikhonov regularisation adds information to the calibration process in order to achieve numerical stability. In contrast, subspace methods achive numerical stability by reducing the dimensionality of the problem, removing and/or combining parameters. When employing SVD in calibration, only parameters and linear combinations of parameters that are suficiently constrained by measured data are estimated. These parameters are said to reside in the *solution space*. Choosing which parameter combinations to estimate is accomplished via singular value decomposition (SVD). SVD-based parameter estimation fixes intial values for parameters/parameter combinations that are not estimable (reside in the *null space*) and does not adjust them during inversion.
