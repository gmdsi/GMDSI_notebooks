We assume the reader has at least some understanding of PEST(++), common file structures and workflows.\n",

    " - introduce how to access and edit an existing PEST control file and setup using the `Pst` class.\n",
    " - explore some of the built-in methods for customizing PEST setups and post-processing outcomes.\n",
    " - introduce geostats in `pyemu`.\n",
    " - introduce methods for handling matricies with the `Matrix` class, as special instances with the `Cov` and `Jco` classes.\n",

    "## Adjusting Weights for \"Visibility\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to estimating parameters using PEST(++), a user must decide how to weight observations. In some\n",
    "cases, it is wise to weight observations strictly according to the inverse of the standard deviation of\n",
    "measurement noise. Certainly, observations of greater credibility should be given greater weights\n",
    "than those of lower credibility. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, when history-matching, this approach can result in the loss of information contained in some observations, due to their contribution to the objective function being over-shadowed by the contribution from other observations. An alternative approach is to weight observations (or observation groups) such that, at the start of the history-matching process, they each contribute the same amount to the objective function. The information content of each of these groups is thereby given equal right of entry to the parameter estimation process. (This matter is extensively discussed in the PEST Book.)\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above, a practical means of accommodating this situation is to weight all observation groups\n",
    "such that they contribute an equal amount to the starting measurement objective function. In this\n",
    "manner, no single group dominates the objective function, or is dominated by others; the information\n",
    "contained in each group is therefore equally “visible” to PEST(++).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Pst.adjust_weights()` method provides a mechanism to fine tune observation weights according to their contribution to the objective function. (*Side note: the PWTADJ1 utility from the PEST-suite automates this same process of \"weighting for visibility\".*) \n",
    "\n",
    "Some **caution** is required here. Observation weights and how these pertain to history-matching *versus* how they pertain to generating an observation ensemble for use with `pestpp-ies` is a frequent source of confusion.\n",
    "\n",
    " - when **history-matching**, observation weights listed in the control file determine their contribution to the objective function, and therefore to the parameter estimation process. Here, observation weights may be assigned to reflect observation uncertainty, the balance required for equal \"visibility\", or other modeller-defined (and perhaps subjective...) measures of observation worth.  \n",

This implies that we were not able to \"fit\" as well as we thought we could (where \"thought\" is encapsulated in the observations weights in the control file, representing the inverse of measurment noise).
