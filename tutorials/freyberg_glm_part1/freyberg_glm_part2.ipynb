    "The current tutorial continues where the \"freyberg glm part1\" notebook left off. The \"freyberg intro to model\" and \"freyberg pstfrom pest setup\" pride details on the model and PEST dataset. The \"freyberg obs and weights\" and \"freyberg glm 1\" notebooks introduced changes to the PEST setup that are relevant to the current tutorial. You do not need to know the details of all these noteboks to follow along with general points of the current tutorial. \n",

    "In this tutorial we will add the final tweaks to a PEST dataset and then calibrate our model using PEST++GLM. Much like PEST, PEST++GLM undertakes highly parameterized inversion. However, it streamlines alot of the user-input process. It also automates FOSM and FOSM-based Monte Carlo uncertainty analyses. This drastically reduces requirements for user input, making workflows easier to implement. However, it also increases the number of moving pieces that a user must be familiar with (no free lunch!).\n",

    "### 2. Regularisation\n",
    "\n",
    "We have an ill-posed inverse problem. The mathematical term for the process through which a unique solution is sought for a nonunique inverse problem is “regularisation”. The goal of regularised inversion is to seek a unique parameter field that results in a suitable fit between model outputs and field measurements, whilst minimizing the potential for wrongness in model predictions. That is, out of all the ways to fit a calibration dataset, regularized inversion seeks the parameter set of minimum error variance.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### 2.1. Tikhonov Regularisation (e.g. \"soft knowledge\")\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to seek a parameter field of minimum error variance is to seek a parameter field that allows the model to fit the calibration dataset, but whose values are also as close as possible to a set of “preferred parameter values”. Ideally, preferred parameter values should also be initial parameter values as listed in the “parameter data” section of the PEST control file. These preferred parameter values are normally close to the centre of the prior parameter probability distribution. At the same time, scales and patterns of departures from the preferred parameter set that are required for model outputs to fit a calibration dataset should be achieved in ways that make “geological sense”.\n",
    "\n",
    "PEST provides a user with a great deal of flexibility in how Tikhonov constraints can be introduced to an inversion process. The easiest way is to do this is through the use of prior information equations. When prior information equations are employed, Tikhonov constraints are expressed through preferred values that are assigned to linear relationships between parameters. (Equality is the simplest type of linear relationship.) Weights must be assigned to these equations. As is described in PEST documentation, when PEST is run in “regularisation” mode, it makes internal adjustments to the weights that are assigned to any observations or prior information equations that belong to special observation groups that are referred to as “regularisation groups”. \n",
    "\n",
    "PEST (and PEST_HP) provide the option to replace prior information equation weights with covariance matrices. When prior information equations embody Tikhonov constraints, they can be used to ensure that patterns of parameter heterogeneity that emerge from the inversion process are geologically reasonable. (See the GMDSI Tutorials for examples of how to accompish this with PEST_HP: https://gmdsi.org/blog/calibration-a-simple-model/)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2. Promoting \"Geologicaly Reasonable\" Patterns: Prior Information Equations vs Regularized-Gauss-Levenburg-Marquardt\n",
    "\n",
    "PEST++GLM (which we will be using here) does things a bit differently. You *can* specify prior information equations and assign relevant weights and run PEST++GLM in \"regularisation\" mode. See the \"intro to pyemu\" notebook for an example of how to specify prior information equations. However, PEST++GLM does not accept covariance matrices for the purposes of specifying preferred parameter heterogeneity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, PEST++GLM offers users the option of using prior parameter covariance matrix based regularisation directly in the parameter upgrade calculation process. Instead of using the contribution of regularisation to the objective function to avoid \"unrealistic\" parameter patterns (as is done in PEST), this approach tries to maintain \"realistic\" patterns directly when calculating parameter upgrades. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we will show further on, this is implemented by specifying a prior parameter covariance matrix and the relevant `pest++` options. If this option is enabled, then prior information equation based regularisation cannot also be employed. Regularisation is controlled by the max singular values and eigen threshold control variables in the SVD section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pragmatically, the latter approach is the easier one to implement within a PEST++ workflow. A modeller will likley have already prepared a prior parameter covariance marix (we have uncertianty on our mind after all...). Thus, only a few lines need to be added to the PEST control file. It also removes the need to determine and dynamically adjust prior information weights, making the process more efficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "This option is activated with the `glm_normal_form(prior)` pest++ option and by providing a prior parameter covariance matrix in `parcov()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by preparing this covariance matrix. Recall that we created a prior covariance matrix in the \"freyberg pstfrom pest setup\" tutorial and saved it in a file named \"prior_cov.jcb\". That matrix contains values for *all* the parameters. We need to reduce it down to only the adjustable parameters in our current \"pilot points\" control file:"

Chief among these is that, for a nonlinear model, the partitioning of parameter space into solution and null spaces based on singular decomposition of a full Jacobian matrix calculated on the basis of initial parameter values may not remain valid as parameter values change. Hence, as the super parameter inversion process progresses, it may become necessary to recalculate a full Jacobian matrix so that super parameters can be re-defined. \n",
