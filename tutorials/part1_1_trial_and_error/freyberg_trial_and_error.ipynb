    "# Manual Trial-and-Error\n",
    "\n",
    "In the current notebook we will explore some concepts through manual history-matching (or trial-and-error). Many of these concepts are explained in greater detail in *Applied Groundwater Modeling (2nd edition)* by Anderson et al. (2015). Here, we will \"manually\" adjust model parameter values, run the model, and then compare model outputs to measured values. This process is repeated until the modeller is satisfied with the fit between measured and simulated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we go any further, allow us to highlight that trial-and-error history matching is rarely, if ever, sufficent in a decision-support modelling context. It can be a useful **first-step** for history-matching, mostly because it provides a modeller with insight about the site and a model's response to parameter changes. In this way, it helps to develop a modeller's \"hydrosense\" - the intuitive understanding of how a model behaves. It can also provide a quick form of quality control on both the model setup as well as the reasonableness of the conceptual model.\n",
    "\n",
    "These benefits notwithstanding, trial-and-error history matching is cumbersome and highly subjective. It is inaplicable in highly-parameterized contexts (we will see why this is important in other tutorials). Comprehensive testing and identification of all insensitive and correlated parameters is not feasible, and it cannot ensure that the best quantifiable fit has been achieved. \n",
    "\n",
    "When undertaking decision-support modelling in practice, more rigorous, automated trial-and-error methodologies are employed. Such methods are the topics of subsequent tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Point:** \n",
    ">Trial-and-error history-matching is may provide some \"soft\" benefit to the modeller. It does not replace automated parameter estimation.\n",

    "## Final Remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "Hopefully after this gruelling exercise you have learnt the value (and lack-thereof) of manual trial-and-error history-matching. We have seen that:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Decisions on which parameters to change, in what order and by how much is subjective and will be subject to each modeller's biases. Thus trial-and-error history matching is not provide a transparent and reproducible process. Nor does it provide a quantifiable \"best fit\" for a given model.\n",
    "2. Here we adjusted 4 parameters. As we saw, this *oversimplified* parameterisation introduced structural error, biasing our prediction. History-matching such a model can actually harm its usefullness to support a decision. Increasing the number of parameters reduces this propensity for bias. But handling more parameters manually quickly becomes an impossible task.\n",
    "3. We saw that certain combinations of parameters can provide similar, or even equal, fits with measured data. Manually identifying parameter correlation is challenging, to say the least. And, once identified, a modeller is forced to (subjectively) choose which parameters to fix, and which to adjust.\n",
    "4. Perhaps most importantly, once again we saw that a good fit with measured data does not equate to a correct prediction. To be usefull in a decision-support context, prediction uncertainty must be characterized.\n"
