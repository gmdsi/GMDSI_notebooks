    "We have more unknown parameters than observations. Thus, we have an ill-posed inverse problem. The mathematical term for the process through which a unique solution is sought for a nonunique inverse problem is “regularisation”. The goal of regularised inversion is to seek a unique parameter field that results in a suitable fit between model outputs and field measurements, whilst minimizing the potential for wrongness in model predictions. That is, out of all the ways to fit a calibration dataset, regularized inversion seeks the parameter set of minimum error variance.\n",
    "\n",

    " 1) adding soft knowledge and/or \n",
    " 2) reducing the problem dimensionality. \n",

    "#### Tikhonov Regularisation (e.g. \"soft knowledge\")\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to seek a parameter field of minimum error variance is to seek a parameter field that allows the model to fit the calibration dataset, but whose values are also as close as possible to a set of \"preferred parameter values\". Ideally, preferred parameter values should also be initial parameter values as listed in the \"parameter data\" section of the PEST control file. These preferred parameter values are normally close to the centre of the prior parameter probability distribution. At the same time, scales and patterns of departures from the preferred parameter set that are required for model outputs to fit a calibration dataset should be achieved in ways that make “geological sense”.\n",
    "\n",
    "PEST provides a user with a great deal of flexibility in how Tikhonov constraints can be introduced to an inversion process. The easiest way is to do this is through the use of prior information equations. When prior information equations are employed, Tikhonov constraints are expressed through preferred values that are assigned to linear relationships between parameters. (Equality is the simplest type of linear relationship.) Weights must be assigned to these equations. As is described in PEST documentation, when PEST is run in “regularisation” mode, it makes internal adjustments to the weights that are assigned to any observations or prior information equations that belong to special observation groups that are referred to as \"regularisation groups\". \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Promoting \"Geologicaly Reasonable\" Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "PEST (and PEST_HP) provide the option to replace prior information equation weights with covariance matrices. When prior information equations embody Tikhonov constraints, they can be used to ensure that patterns of parameter heterogeneity that emerge from the inversion process are geologically reasonable. (See the GMDSI Tutorials for examples of how to accomplish this with PEST_HP: https://gmdsi.org/blog/calibration-a-simple-model/)\n",
    "\n",
    "PEST++GLM (which we will be using here) does things a bit differently. You *can* specify prior information equations and assign relevant weights and run PEST++GLM in \"regularisation\" mode. (See the \"intro to pyemu\" notebook for an example of how to specify prior information equations.) However, PEST++GLM does not accept covariance matrices for the purposes of specifying preferred parameter heterogeneity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, PEST++GLM offers users the option of using prior parameter covariance matrix based regularisation directly in the parameter upgrade calculation process - referred to as Regularized-Gauss-Levenburg-Marquardt. Instead of using the contribution of regularisation to the objective function to avoid \"unrealistic\" parameter patterns (as is done in PEST), this approach tries to maintain \"realistic\" patterns directly when calculating parameter upgrades. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we will show further on, this is implemented by specifying a prior parameter covariance matrix and the relevant `pest++` options. If this option is enabled, then prior information equation based regularisation cannot also be employed. Regularisation is controlled by the maximum singular values `MAXSING` and singular value threshold `EIGTHRESH` control variables in the SVD section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pragmatically, the latter approach is the easier one to implement within a PEST++ workflow. A modeller will likley have already prepared a prior parameter covariance matrix (we have uncertainty on our mind after all...). Thus, only a few lines need to be added to the PEST control file. It also removes the need to determine and dynamically adjust prior information weights, making the process numerically more efficient. \n",

In contrast, subspace methods do so by reducing the dimensionality of the problem, removing and/or combining parameters. When employing SVD in calibration, only parameters and linear combinations of parameters that are sufficiently constrained by measured data are estimated. These parameters are said to reside in the *solution space*. Choosing which parameter combinations to estimate is accomplished via singular value decomposition (SVD).

    "Use of PEST’s “SVD-assist” methodology can promulgate significant increases in the numerical efficiency of highly parameterized inversion. In implementing this methodology, PEST estimates the values of so-called “super parameters” in place of the parameters themselves. Singular vectors derived from SVD contain components of every base parameter in an orthogonal projection proportional to the information content of each base parameter on each singular vector. As a result, base parameter values can be scaled by proportions that are maintained and adjusted all at once as parameters for the model. These are the \"super parameters\". If the system is totally linear, these mappings will be preserved despite changes in the base parameter values. in reality, most of the time this is at least somewhat nonlinear requiring relinearization as discussed below.\n",

Hence, as the super parameter inversion process progresses, it may become necessary to recalculate a full Jacobian matrix so that super parameters can be re-defined. \n",

This accounts for the model's ability to reproduce an observation. Effectively, it assumes that the residual is a measure of measurement noise + model error. Thus, observation weights used during FOSM are calculated as the inverse of the residual.

Each of these parameter realisation is then simulated. As long as forecasts are included as observations in the control file, then the Monte Carlo process provides an ensemble of forecast values.

    "Does the FOSM posterior (blue-shaded area) overlap the Monte Carlo posterior (blue columns) for all forecasts? If so, that's good news. It means the assumed linear parameter-forecast relation in the FOSM calculations holds true. If it does not, then the usefulness of FOSM for forecast uncertainty analysis is eroded.\n",

    "Because we are working with a synthetic case for which we know the truth, we can also assess whether forecast posteriors include the true value. Naturally, this would not be possible for a real-world case. Do each of the red lines fall within the FOSM (blue shaded area) and Monte Carlo (blue column) posteriors? If so, then technically uncertainty analysis has not failed. #winning. If not, then it has failed. #majorbadtimes.\n",

    "In this case we have done a pretty good job. We seem to have avoided underestimating uncertainty, even for the difficult null-space dependent forecasts. Counterintuitively, we did so by _not_ getting a really good fit with with measured data. Only _as good_ a fit as is reasonable given the information content therein. "
