    " As we've said, the key to representative environmental models is allowing high levels of flexibility through a highly parameterized approach.  But this makes our parameter estimation problem illposed and underdetermined, which means our solution is nonunique even if we overcome problems of increased instability and longer runtimes.  Here we use a \"regularized inversion\" approach to overcome these problems.  Regularization is anything that makes an intractable problem solvable; for example, using a small number of zones (not highly-parameterized) is a way to regularize an illposed problem.  Regularization as we use here can be grouped into two broad categories: \n",
    " 1. adding soft-knowledge to the problem (Tikhonov regularization) and \n",
    " 2. mathematically reducing the dimensionality of the model (subspace regularization via singular value decomposition (SVD)). In practice we typically use a combination (\"hybrid\") of these two approaches. \n",
    "\n",
    " It is worth expounding on this difference in regularization approaches. In contrast to Tikhonov regularization, which adds information to the calibration process to achieve numerical stability, subspace methods achieve stability through subtracting parameters, and/or parameter combinations, from the calibration process (making a \"subspace\" of the full parameter space). Now the calibration process is no longer required to estimate either individual parameters or combinations of correlated parameters that are inestimable given the calibration dataset we have. What combinations are estimable are automatically determined through SVD. \n",
    "\n",
    " The effort needed to take advantage of these regularization strategies is also appreciably different, where SVD is relatively easily brought to bear and becomes \"set it and forget it\". Moreover, when SVD is used the parameter estimation problem always becomes __unconditionally stable__! Neither of these is true in all cases when adding soft knowledge using Tikhonov regularization. \n",
    "\n",
    " In summary, SVD benefits apply to all models so it is worth widely invoking when using PEST and PEST++.  SVD involves few parameter estimation inputs, default values work for a large range of problems, and it addresses instability for all problems. Can you catch that we can't overemphasize the importance of SVD to parameter estimation?  \"Magic\" indeed! \n"

A high-level understanding is not needed to take advantage of the power of SVD for your typical calibration parameter estimation problem (\"set it and forget it\").
