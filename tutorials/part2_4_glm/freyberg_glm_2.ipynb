The \"freyberg intro to model\" and \"freyberg pstfrom pest setup\" provide details on the model and PEST dataset. The \"freyberg glm 1\" notebooks introduced changes to the PEST setup that are relevant to the current tutorial. You do not need to know the details of all these noteboks to follow along with general points of the current tutorial - but it helps! \n",

However, it streamlines alot of the user-input process. It also automates FOSM and FOSM-based Monte Carlo uncertainty analyses. This drastically reduces requirements for user input, making workflows easier to implement. However, it also increases the number of moving pieces that a user must be familiar with (no free lunch!).\n",

    "## Regularisation\n",
    "\n",
    "We have more unkown parameters than observations. Thus, we have an ill-posed inverse problem. The mathematical term for the process through which a unique solution is sought for a nonunique inverse problem is “regularisation”. The goal of regularised inversion is to seek a unique parameter field that results in a suitable fit between model outputs and field measurements, whilst minimizing the potential for wrongness in model predictions. That is, out of all the ways to fit a calibration dataset, regularized inversion seeks the parameter set of minimum error variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main approaches used to stabilize this problem: \n",
    " 1) adding soft knowledge and/or \n",

    "#### Tikhonov Regularisation (e.g. \"soft knowledge\")\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to seek a parameter field of minimum error variance is to seek a parameter field that allows the model to fit the calibration dataset, but whose values are also as close as possible to a set of “preferred parameter values”. Ideally, preferred parameter values should also be initial parameter values as listed in the “parameter data” section of the PEST control file. These preferred parameter values are normally close to the centre of the prior parameter probability distribution. At the same time, scales and patterns of departures from the preferred parameter set that are required for model outputs to fit a calibration dataset should be achieved in ways that make “geological sense”.\n",
    "\n",
    "PEST provides a user with a great deal of flexibility in how Tikhonov constraints can be introduced to an inversion process. The easiest way is to do this is through the use of prior information equations. When prior information equations are employed, Tikhonov constraints are expressed through preferred values that are assigned to linear relationships between parameters. (Equality is the simplest type of linear relationship.) Weights must be assigned to these equations. As is described in PEST documentation, when PEST is run in “regularisation” mode, it makes internal adjustments to the weights that are assigned to any observations or prior information equations that belong to special observation groups that are referred to as “regularisation groups”. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Promoting \"Geologicaly Reasonable\" Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "PEST (and PEST_HP) provide the option to replace prior information equation weights with covariance matrices. When prior information equations embody Tikhonov constraints, they can be used to ensure that patterns of parameter heterogeneity that emerge from the inversion process are geologically reasonable. (See the GMDSI Tutorials for examples of how to accompish this with PEST_HP: https://gmdsi.org/blog/calibration-a-simple-model/)\n",
    "\n",
    "PEST++GLM (which we will be using here) does things a bit differently. You *can* specify prior information equations and assign relevant weights and run PEST++GLM in \"regularisation\" mode. (See the \"intro to pyemu\" notebook for an example of how to specify prior information equations.) However, PEST++GLM does not accept covariance matrices for the purposes of specifying preferred parameter heterogeneity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, PEST++GLM offers users the option of using prior parameter covariance matrix based regularisation directly in the parameter upgrade calculation process - referred to as Regularized-Gauss-Levenburg-Marquardt. Instead of using the contribution of regularisation to the objective function to avoid \"unrealistic\" parameter patterns (as is done in PEST), this approach tries to maintain \"realistic\" patterns directly when calculating parameter upgrades. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we will show further on, this is implemented by specifying a prior parameter covariance matrix and the relevant `pest++` options. If this option is enabled, then prior information equation based regularisation cannot also be employed. Regularisation is controlled by the max singular values and eigen threshold control variables in the SVD section.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pragmatically, the latter approach is the easier one to implement within a PEST++ workflow. A modeller will likley have already prepared a prior parameter covariance marix (we have uncertianty on our mind after all...). Thus, only a few lines need to be added to the PEST control file. It also removes the need to determine and dynamically adjust prior information weights, making the process numerically more efficient. \n",

In contrast, subspace methods do so by reducing the dimensionality of the problem, removing and/or combining prameters. When employing SVD in calibration, only parameters and linear combinations of parameters that are suficiently constrained by measured data are estimated. These parameters are said to reside in the *solution space*. Chossing which parameter combinations to estimate is accomplished via singular value decomposition (SVD). SVD-based parameter estimation fixes intial values for parameters/parameter combinations that are not estimable (reside in the *null space*) and does not adjust them during inversion.

This accounts for the model's ability to reproduce an obsevration. Effectively, it assumes that the residual is a measure of measurement noise + model error. Thus, observation weights used during FOSM are calcualted as the inverse of the residual. Note that this \"residual weight\" never increases weights beyond those which are specified in the control file! The assumption is that weighs in the control file represent the inverse of measurment noise standard deviation - and it would be illogical to decrease noise beyond this level. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to keep this in mind. If observation weights in the control file do **not** represent measurement noise, then it may be preferable to not use PEST++GLM to undertake FOSM during parameter estimation. In our case, weights represent the inverse of measurment standard deviations - so we are all good!"

FOSM-based posterior Monte Carlo (also called Bayes-linear Monte Carlo) is implemented by drawing samples of parameters from the posterior parameter distribution (described by the posterior parameter covariance matrix and assuming best-fit parameter values as the mean). Each of these parameter realisation is then simulated. As long as forecasts are included as observations in the control file, then the Monte Carlo process provides an ensemble of forecast values. With enough samples of foreacast the posterior predictive uncertainty can be described.
