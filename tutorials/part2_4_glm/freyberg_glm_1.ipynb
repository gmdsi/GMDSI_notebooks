    "# Filling a Jacobian Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is an optional, but recommended, first step for a workflow that implements linear uncertainty analysis (i.e. FOSM), data worth analysis and highly-parameterized regularised inversion (i.e. calibration). It will be relatively short, but provides the foundation for subsequet tutorials. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are going to calculate a base Jacobian. In other words, we are going to calculate partial derivatives of model outputs with respect to (adjustable) model parameters. Or \"how much each observation value changes for a change in each parameter value\".  These partial derivatives (or *sensitivity coefficients*) are fundamental for the implementation of inversion and for linear uncertainty analysis. They form a two-dimensional array of values with as many rows as observations and as many columns as parameters. This array is commonly known as the **Jacobian matrix**. \n",
    "\n",
    "PEST and PEST++GLM (as well as some other PEST++ versions) calculate and record a Jacobian as part of normal execution. They do so by running \"the model\" as many times as there are adjustable parameters. Each time, a parameter is adjusted and the corresponding effects on all observations are recorded. These are used to fill in the Jacobian matrix. Once the Jacobian is calculated, the derivative information is used to identify parameter changes that will improve the fit between model outputs and measured data. These are used to update the \"calibrated\" parameter set. Due to the nonlinear nature of groundwater inverse problems, this process may need to be repeated numerous times during calibration. As you can imagine, if there are many adjustable parameters, this process can take up a lot of computation time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Filling the Jacobian is perhaps the main computational cost of derivative-based optimisation methods such as are implemented in PEST and PEST++GLM. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, this cost is often worth it, as a Jacobian matrix has many uses. Many of these uses are as important as the model calibration process itself. Hence it is not unusual for PEST or PEST++GLM to be run purely for the purpose of filling a Jacobian matrix (as we will do here). \n",
    "\n",
    "Uses to which a Jacobian matrix may be put include the following:\n",
    " - Examination of local sensitivities of model outputs to parameters and/or decision variables.\n",
    " - Giving PEST or PEST++GLM a “head start” in calibrating a model by providing it with a pre-calculated Jacobian matrix to use in its first iteration. For PEST++GLM this is achieved through use of the `base_jacobian()` control variable, as we will demonstrate in a subsequent tutorial.\n",
    " - To support the many types of linear analysis implemented by utility programs supplied with PEST, and functions provided by `pyEMU`; these calculate:\n",
    "    - parameter identifiability;\n",
    "    - parameter and predictive uncertainty;\n",
    "    - parameter contributions to predictive uncertainty;\n",
    "    - data worth;\n",
    "    - the effects of model defects.\n"

Normally, you will want to use the same number of agents (or less) as you have available CPU cores. Most personal computers (i.e. desktops or laptops) these days have between 4 and 10 cores. Servers or HPCs may have many more cores than this. Another limitation to keep in mind is the read/write speed of your machines disk (e.g. your hard drive). PEST and the model software are going to be reading and writting lots of files. This often slows things down if agents are competing for the same resources to read/write to disk. (It also wears through SSD drives...)\n",
