    "# Pilot Points Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until this point we have been calibrating the Freyberg model with only two parameters (`hk1` and `rch0`). These parameters' values are applied to the entire model domain, not accounting for potential spatial heterogeneity. This is a pretty coarse parameterisation approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the past (i.e. the dark ages), parameter spatial characterization was often implemented using zones of piece-wise constant values. Such parameterisation schemes were often subjective, inflexible and provide coarse representations of how physical properties vary in space. Parameterisation schemes that rely solely on zones should be treated with caution and/or an understanding of the inherent structural error which they bring with them. We will not be using zone-based approaches in these tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods of spatial parameterisation based on pilot points reduce these issues. With pilot point based parameterisation, parameter values are assigned to a set of points throughout the model domain rather than the model grid directly. Property values are then assigned to the model grid through spatial interpolation from pilot points. This results in a smooth spatially varying property field. \n",
    "\n",
    "This introduces the need for a model pre-processor that handles interpolation from pilot points to the model grid (and assigns values to model input files). The PLPROC suite of software is one option. `pyEMU` includes python-based alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will employ pilot points to parameterize hydraulic conductivity in the Freyberg model discussed in previous tutorials. Here, we will be adding pilot points to an existing pest setup. This may be usefull in some cases, especially when dealing with legacy models. However, it may be a non-standard workflow.  The approach demonstrated in this notebook is __not__ the recommended approach to construct a highly-parameterized PEST setup with `pyEMU`. We are using it here simply to maintain a coherent narative throughout the `Part1` tutorial notebooks. See `Part2` of the GMDSI Notebooks for a tutorial on `pyemu.PstFrom` for an preferred workflow when starting parameterization from scratch."
