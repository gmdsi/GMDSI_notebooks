    "As we've seen, First-Order-Second-Moment (FOSM) is quick and insightful.  But FOSM depends on an assumption that the relation between the model and the forecast uncertainty is linear.  But many times the world is nonlinear. Short cuts like FOSM need assumptions, but we can free ourselves by taking the brute force approach.  That is define the parameters that are important, provide the prior uncertainty, sample those parameters many times, run the model many times, and then summarize the results.  \n",

    "On a more practical standpoint, the underlying theory for FOSM and why it results in shortcomings can be hard to explain to stakeholders.  Monte Carlo, however, is VERY straightforward, its computational brute force notwithstanding. \n",
