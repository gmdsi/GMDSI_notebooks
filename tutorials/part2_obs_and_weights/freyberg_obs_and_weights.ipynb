    "# Formulating the Objective Function and The Dark Art of Weighting\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective function expresses model-to-measurement misfit for use in the solution of an inverse problem through the *weighted squared difference between measured and simulated observations*. There is no formula for a universally \"best approach\" to formulate an objective function. However, the universal underlying principle is to ensure that as much information as possible is transferred to the parameters of a model, in as \"safe\" a way as possible (Doherty, 2015). \n",
    "\n",
    "What do we mean by \"safe\"? We mean that, in attempting to fit model outputs to measured observations, we should minimize the potential for model structural error to induce model parameters to take on values that compensate for model imperfections. When estimated parameters take on compensating roles, the potential for error in predictions may actually increase, rather than decrease, during the process of calibration (White et al. 2014). And we don't want that!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observation Types**\n",
    "\n",
    "In most history matching contexts a “multicomponent” objective function is recommended. Each component of this objective function is calculated on the basis of different groups of observations or of the same group of observations processed in different ways. In a nut-shell, this means as many (useful!) types of observation as are available should be included in the parameter-estimation process. This does not **just** mean different \"measurement types\"! It also means teasing out components *within* a given measurement type. These \"secondary\" components often contain information that is otherwise lost or overshadowed. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Grouping** \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a multicomponent approach can extract as much information from an observation dataset as possible and transfer this information to estimated parameters. When constructing a PEST dataset, it is often usefull (and convenient) to group observations by type. This makes it easier to customize objective function design and track the flow of infromation from data to parameters (and subsequently to predictions). Ideally, each observation grouping should illuminate and constrain the parameter estimation related to a separate aspect of the system beiong modelled (Doherty and Hunt, 2010). For example, absolute values of heads may inform parameters that control horizontal flow patterns, whilst vertical diferences between heads in different aquifers may inform parameters that control vertical flow patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Weighting**\n",
    "\n",
    "A user must decide how to weight observations before estimating parameters with PEST. In some cases, it is prudent to strictly weight observations based on the inverse of the standard deviation of measurement noise. Observations with higher credibility should, without a doubt, be given more weight than those with lower credibility. However, in many history-matching contexts, model defects are just as important as noise in inducing model-to-measurement misfit as field measurements. Some types of model outputs are more affected by model imperfections than others. Notably, the effects of imperfections on model output differences (whether spatial or temporal) are frequently less than their effects on raw model outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, including measurement differences and corresponding model output differences in a calibration dataset can often improve a history-matching process. It can also be improved by dividing components of a measurement dataset into groups based on type and location, assigning these measurements to different observation groups, and ensuring that the contributions made by each of these groups to the original objective function are roughly the same. In the parameter estimation process, the information content of each of these groups is thus given equal weight. In other cases, accommodating the \"structural\" nature of model-to-measurement misfit is preferable (i.e. the model is inherently better at fitting some measurements than others). \n",
    "\n",
    "The PEST Book (Doherty, 2015) and the USGS published report \"A Guide to Using PEST for Groundwater-Model Calibration\" (Doherty et al 2010) go into detail on formulating an objective function and discuss common issues with certain data-types. \n",

    "\n",
    "The modified Freyberg model is introduced in another tutorial notebook (see \"freyberg intro to model\"). The current notebook picks up following the \"freyberg psfrom pest setup\" notebook, in which a high-dimensional PEST dataset was constructed using `pyemu.PstFrom`. You may also wish to go through the \"intro to pyemu\" notebook beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now address assigning observation target values from \"measured\" data and observation weighting prior to history matching. \n",

    " - head time-series\n",
    " - river flux time-series\n",
    " - temporal differences between both heads and flux time-series\n",
    " - vertical head differences\n",
    "\n",
    "We also included many observations of model outputs for which we do not have measured data. We kept these to make it easier to keep track of model outputs (this becomes a necessity when working with ensembles). We also included observations of \"forecasts\", i.e. model outputs of managment interest.\n",

    "### 5. Understanding Observation Weights and Measurement Noise\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a common source of confusion: observation weights for history matching *versus* observation weights representing observation error. \n",
    "\n",
    " - when **history-matching**, observation weights listed in the control file determine their contribution to the objective function and therefore their influence on the parameter estimation process. Here, observation weights may be assigned to reflect observation uncertainty, the balance required for equal \"visibility\", or other modeller-defined (and perhaps subjective...) measures of observation worth.  \n",
    " - when undertaking **FOSM** or when **generating an observation ensemble** for use with `pestpp-ies`, weights should reflect the inverse of the standard deviation of measurement noise. \n",
    "    - Keep in mind that, unless instructed otherwise, `pestpp-ies` will generate an observation ensemble *using observation weights in the PEST control file*. Therefore, when history-matching with `pestpp-ies` and using weights that **do not** reflect observation uncertainty, it is important to provide `pestpp-ies` with a previously prepared observation ensemble. \n",
    "    - Another aspect to consider is that, (unless instructed not to) `pestpp-glm` undertakes FOSM during parameter estimation. In doing so, observation weights in the control file influence how observation noise is calculated. The assumption being that weights are the inverse of standard deviation of measurement noise. If a \"weighting for visibility\" approach is adopted, then FOSM undertaken by `pestpp-glm` will no longer be representative. Instead, FOSM should be undertaken separetly (e.g. using pyEMU or the PEST utilities).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in the current tutorial our observation weights no longer reflect measurement noise. If we were to use this control file with `pestpp-ies` later, we would have to explicitly provide an observation ensemble. If we were to use it for parameter estimation with `pestpp-glm`, we would need to undertake FOSM in a subsequent step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will generate an observation ensemble and visualize the effect of different weighting schemes."
