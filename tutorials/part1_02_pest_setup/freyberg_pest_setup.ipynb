    "# A Whirlwind Introduction to PEST(++)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we introduce the automated parameter estimation tools PEST and PEST++. This introduction is far from comprehensive. Our goal here is to provide you the basics to understand the \"plumbing\" of how PEST interacts with a \"model\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that, for all its sophistication, formal statistical parameter estimation software does the same things as a modeler does during manual trial-and-error.  It (1) assigns best guess parameter values, (2) runs the model, (3) compares model outputs to measured values, (4) if model-to-measurment fit is inadequate, it adjusts parameter values and repeats the process. Once model-to-measurement fit ceases to improve, it stops. All of these steps must be automated. All of the decision criteria must also be quantified and are recorded, making the process transparent and reproducible.\n",

    "Here is a flow chart of manual trial-and-error history matching from *Applied Groundwater Modeling (2nd edition)* by [Anderson et al. (2015)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9780120581030/applied-groundwater-modeling): \n",

    "## The PEST Input Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "PEST and PEST++ are called \"universal\" or \"model-independent\" inverse codes because they can be bolted on the outside of any model.  Well, that is, any model they can talk to and run, which means the model needs to meet these two criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. The model input and output are ASCII text files or can be converted to text files.\n",
    " 2. The model can be run at the command line without user intervention (also known as \"batch mode\").\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we will get under the hood and see how PEST communicates with the model. To do all of this we need to build a PEST input dataset, which is comprised of three file types:\n",
    "\n",
    " - template files,\n",
    " - instruction files,\n",
    " - PEST control file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever PEST runs a model, it must first write parameter values to model input files. PEST requires\n",
    "template files in order to know how to write model input files in ways that the model expects. By\n",
    "convention, template files are provided with an extension of “.tpl”. A unique template file is required for each model input file that contains parameters which PEST must adjust.\n",
    "\n",
    "After running the model, PEST must read observations from model output files. PEST requires instruction files in order to know where to find observation values in the output files. By convention, instruction files are provided with an extension \".ins\". A single instruction file is required for each model output file which PEST must read.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any particular PEST run there is only one PEST control file. As is implied by the name, the information in this file \"controls\" PEST behaviour. This file contains information on how PEST decides to update parameters, whether the fit is \"good enough\", where model input and output files are located, how to run the model and so on. The control file is divided into sections. Each section has a specifc format and layout in which variables can be included. Many of these variables can be assigned with default values and will only require adjustment in specifc cases. We will discuss the more pertinent (or common) ones as we progress through the various tutorials. The PEST and PEST++ user manuals provide further detail. Users are encouraged to take the time to read these documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most groundwater modelling graphical user interfaces (GUIs) support construction of PEST input\n",
    "datasets of varying complexity. In many cases, PEST setup achieved in this way is fit for purpose.\n",
    "However, no GUI is able to cater for every conceivable history-matching context. Hence there are\n",
    "many contexts in which a user may need to construct their own PEST input dataset. Doing so in a programatic environment makes this process automatable, replicable and much less painful. `pyEMU` provides a `python` based interface that facilitates PEST-based workflows.  In this tutorial we will start by constructing some of the PEST dataset \"manually\" so that you become familiar with what goes on in the background. Then, we will begin to introduce the use of `pyEMU`. Other tutorials provide general overview to `pyEMU` (see the \"intro to pyemu\" notebook) and demonstrate how to build a high-dimensional PEST interface from scratch (see the \"freyberg pstfrom pest setup\" notebook). But we are getting ahead of ourselves - we will get to those notebooks further along in the course."

    "In the PEST control file we specify each template file __and__ the associated model input file we want PEST to create after it has updated estimates for the parameters on separate lines.

    "\n",
    " 1. The first line of the TPL file must identify that it is a template file by listing \"`ptf ~`\" where \"`~`\" is a \"parameter delimiter\" that tells PEST where a parameter sits in the file. We used a tilde here, but it can be any symbol. __However__, whatever delimiter symbol is listed in the first line must be used consistently throughout that template file.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. The template file looks exactly like the original model input file __BUT__ parameters are substituted for the  model input(s) that we want PEST to estimate.  Parameters are identified by surrounding the parameter name listed in the PEST control (.pst) file with the delimiter.  For the \"`~`\" delimiter that we used above, and a horizontal K parameter named \"`hk1`\" listed as a parameter in a PEST .pst file, the template file would have \"`~   hk1 ~`\" __wherever that Kh value__ was listed in the original model input file. \n",
    "   * Note that the parameter name can be anywhere between the parameter delimiters\n",
    "   * PEST will fill the space up to and including the parameter delimiters with a value, so make them as wide as possible for maximum precision\n",
    "   \n",
    "**So!** \n",
    "\n",
    "\"`~    hk1    ~`\" will be replaced by the value for `hk1` specified by PEST. If that value is 3.14, PEST will write \"`3.14000000000`\" in its place.\n",

    "\n",
    " * The first line on an .ins file must be \"`pif ~`\" where \"`~`\" is a \"marker delimiter\"--a symbol that can be used to identify text to search for.  It is expected on this first line but it's not always used.\n",
    " * The scripting options are extensive but particular. Some options on how to navigate to the numerical data you want to read are:\n",
    "   1. Using a line advance.  PEST starts at the very top the model output file, and you have to move down 1 line to get to the first line that you see in the model output. You can tell PEST to move down the file _`n`_ lines using the `l` character (=lowercase letter l) with a number.  So \"`l1`\" moves down one line, \"`l3`\" moves down 3 lines.  \n",
    "   2. Using the marker delimiter, the INS file can search through a file until it finds a \"primary marker\". For example:  \n",
    "   \"`~VOLUMETRIC BUDGET FOR ENTIRE MODEL~`\" can be used to search for budgets in a LST file  \n",
    "   This is particularly well suited for output files (like a LST file) that have unpredictable lengths.  Note though that PEST will always start at the top of the file and go down, never up and never wrapping once it reaches the end.  This can be a problem when the order of some observations with respect to other observations is not consistent (e.g., some MODPATH output).  When searching for mutiple observations that may vary in order in an output file, it is easiest to have multiple instruction files open the same model output file multiple times so you are always starting at the top of the file (PEST does not mind). \n",
    "   3. Next, you can search for a \"secondary marker\" within a line using the marker delimiter again. This navigates from the left of the line until the secondary marker is found.\n",
    "   4. Once on the line you can specify which columns on a line to extract.  So a line in an instruction file that says `~101  138~ (depth_T2-90)46:58` means that PEST will look for `101  138` in the model output file (with the exact number of spaces between the two numbers) then extract column `46:58` to determine the model output that equates to the target observation `depth_T2-90` that is listed in the PEST control file.   \n",
    "5. Finally, you can read in whitespace-delimited numerical data using \"`!`\" around the observation name:  \n",
    "   for example, if the output file is:  \n",
    "      > ```\n",
    "      > Output file from run 5\n",
    "      > Run date: 1/1/2012\n",
    "      > Run time: 24.3 hours\n",

    "      > ...\n",
    "      > ```  \n",
    "      The instruction file would be like \n",
    "      >  ```\n",
    "      > pif ~\n",
    "      >  ~Head Observations~\n",
    "      >  l1 ~H1=~ !h1val! ~H2=~ !h2val!\n",

    "  \n",
    "These are only a few of the most commonly used options but more options, and more detail on these, are available in the PEST manual.  \n",

    "**PRO TIP**: _The Instruction File syntax is very flexible and enables the reading of complicated model output files. However, for users familiar with scripting and text-processing tools (e.g. Python and regular expressions) it can be easier to write a postprocessing code that extracts observation values from model output and writes them out into a simple tabular format for which a PEST instruction file is easy to write and debug._"
