    "# Prior Monte Carlo\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior-based (or \"unconstrained\") Monte Carlo is a useful, but quite often underused, analysis. It is conceptually simple, does not require much in terms of algorithmic controls and forces the modeller to think about the prior parameter probability distribution - both the mean vector (i.e. the initial parameter values) and the prior parameter covariance matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is simple: sample many sets of parameters (i.e. an ensemble) from a prior probability distribution and run the model forward for each realization in this ensemble and collate the results. Do not try and fit historical data (yet!). Do not throw any of the simulations out because they \"do not represent historical data well\". This allows us to explore the entire range of model outcomes across the (prior) range of parameter values. It let's us investigate model stability (e.g. can the model setup handle the parameters we are throwing at it?). It also let's us start to think critically about what observations the model will be able to match. If we can't match observations we can explore deficiencies in the parameters, the model, or even the observation values themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, it shows us that history matching is not required - saving us a whole lot of time and effort!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will demonstrate:\n",
    " - how to use `pyemu` to run `pestpp` in parallel locally (that is on your machine only)\n",
    " - using `pestpp-swp` or `pestpp-ies` to undertake prior monte carlo with an existing geostatistically correlated prior parameter ensemble\n",
    " - using `pestpp-ies` to undertake prior monte carlo with an uncorrelated prior parameter ensemble \n",
    " - post-processing stochastic model outputs\n",

    "### The modified Freyberg PEST dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The modified Freyberg model is introduced in another tutorial notebook (see [\"intro to freyberg model\"](../part0_02_intro_to_freyberg_model/intro_freyberg_model.ipynb)). The current notebook picks up following the [\"freyberg psfrom pest setup\"](../part2_01_pstfrom_pest_setup/freyberg_pstfrom_pest_setup.ipynb) notebook, in which a high-dimensional PEST dataset was constructed using `pyemu.PstFrom`.

Worry not, we will get to this in subsequent tutorials.\n"
