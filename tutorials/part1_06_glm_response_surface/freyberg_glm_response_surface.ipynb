    "# Gauss-Levenberg-Marquardt (GLM) algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gauss-Levenberg-Marquart (GLM) method is a derivative-based method used to search the objective function surface for its minimum value. It assumes that simulated values of observation targets vary continuously in response to changes in calibration-adjusted model parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, certain combinations of parameters can provide similar fits to calibration data (as we saw in the \"freyberg k and r\" tutorial, in which we attempt to calibrate a model with two correlated parameters). This phenomenon is refered to as non-uniqueness. For a two-parameter case, this can be visualized as a \"trough\" in the objective function surface. In such cases, there is no single \"minimum\" value for the objective function. #dispair\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, PEST(++) may obtain a solution to an ill-posed inverse problem and even fit the calibration dataset very well. This occurs due to the addition of the Marquardt lambda to the diagonal of the $J^{t}QJ$ matrix and enables the achievement of a set of parameters which minimize the objective function. However, this parameter set will not be unique. Changing observation weights, initial parameter values, or a different Marquardt lambda selection strategy, may result in an entirely different set of parameters which also minimize the objective function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this can be avoided by ensuring a well-posed inverse problem. In simple terms, this requires having a greater number of sources of calibration data than the number of adjustable parameters. As we saw in the \"freyberg k, r and flux observations\" tutorial, one option is to include multiple types of observation data which inform different parameter types. (As we will see further on, regularisation provides another.)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we are going to visualize the \"objective function surface\" and how the parameter ugrade process moves across it. "

    "# Understanding Lambdas\n",
    "\n",
    "When used to undertake highly parameterized inversion, PESTPP-GLM implements theory and methodologies that are programmed into PEST. Some theory, employing matrices and vectors, is used to describe the linearized inverse problem on which so-called “gradient methods” are based. Through repeated linearization of the inverse problem over successive iterations, these methods achieve their purpose of model calibration, notwithstanding the nonlinear relationship that exists between model outputs and model parameters.  It should also be noted that PESTPP-IES also implements the GLM solution, but an ensemble of parameter vectors.  So the single trajectory below can be thought of as one of the many tradjectories that ensemble of parameter vectors take.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonlinear model behaviour is also accommodated by introducing a so-called \"Marquardt lambda\" to these equations. Employing a nonzero lambda tweaks the direction of parameter improvement so that it is more aligned with the objective function gradient. This increases the efficiency of early iterations of the inversion process when implemented in conjunction with a nonlinear model.\n",
    "\n",
    "If Lambdas are high, then the parameter estimation process updates parameter values accodring to the objective function gradient. If they are small (or zero), parameter upgrades receive a greater influence from the $J^{t}QJ$ matrix. \n",
    "\n",
    "Highy non-linear problems, in particular, benefit from high lambdas at the start of the parameter estimation process. This accomodates non-elipticity of the objective function surface, avoiding sending the parameter estimation process in the \"wrong direction\" and wasting computation time. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, as the objective function minimum is approached, the process becomes more eficient if smaller lambdas are used. This avoids the phenomenon known as \"hemstitching\", in which parameter upgrades jump-across small, thin \"troughs\" in the objective function surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note again, the effect of lambda on the parameter upgrade is the same in PESTPP-IES.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the PEST Book (Doherty, 2015) and the PEST++ users manual for more details.\n"
