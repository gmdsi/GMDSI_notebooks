abstract = {Abstract Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are commonly used to construct and postprocess numerical groundwater flow and transport models. Scripting model development with the programming language Python is presented here as an alternative approach. One advantage of Python is that there are many packages available to facilitate the model development process, including packages for plotting, array manipulation, optimization, and data analysis. For MODFLOW-based models, the FloPy package was developed by the authors to construct model input files, run the model, and read and plot simulation results. Use of Python with the available scientific packages and FloPy facilitates data exploration, alternative model evaluations, and model analyses that can be difficult to perform with GUIs. Furthermore, Python scripts are a complete, transparent, and repeatable record of the modeling process. The approach is introduced with a simple FloPy example to create and postprocess a MODFLOW model. A more complicated capture-fraction analysis with a real-world model is presented to demonstrate the types of analyses that can be performed using Python and FloPy.},

  abstract = {The design and implementation of effective environmental policies need to be informed by a holistic understanding of the system processes (biophysical, social and economic), their complex interactions, and how they respond to various changes. Models, integrating different system processes into a unified framework, are seen as useful tools to help analyse alternatives with stakeholders, assess their outcomes, and communicate results in a transparent way. This paper reviews five common approaches or model types that have the capacity to integrate knowledge by developing models that can accommodate multiple issues, values, scales and uncertainty considerations, as well as facilitate stakeholder engagement. The approaches considered are: systems dynamics, Bayesian networks, coupled component models, agent-based models and knowledge-based models (also referred to as expert systems). We start by discussing several considerations in model development, such as the purpose of model building, the availability of qualitative versus quantitative data for model specification, the level of spatio-temporal detail required, and treatment of uncertainty. These considerations and a review of applications are then used to develop a framework that aims to assist modellers and model users in the choice of an appropriate modelling approach for their integrated assessment applications and that enables more effective learning in interdisciplinary settings.}

Constrained optimization uses models to systematically explore the interplay between remedial design and contaminant fate, considering uncertainty. Sequential Linear Programming (SLP) provides a design alternative addressing a single goal (e.g. maximum hydraulic containment, maximum mass removal). Multi-objective algorithms like Nondominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) explore the tradeoffs among such objectives and more (e.g. cost, public-supply well contamination). We explore both approaches at a contaminated site in Long Island, New York USA. We compare the algorithms and ramifications on results. NSGA-II explores, at additional computational cost, explicit tradeoffs among multiple objectives, providing additional insights relative to SLP. The NGSA-II algorithm allows for graphical consideration of three objectives. SLP decision variables often settle at predetermined bounds. Bounds assignment thus differs from parameter estimation; bounds must be acceptable rather than safeguards.}

  abstract = {Abstract A numerical surface-water/groundwater model was developed for the lower San Antonio River Basin to evaluate the responses of low base flows and groundwater levels within the basin under conditions of reduced recharge and increased groundwater withdrawals. Batch data assimilation through history matching used a simulation of historical conditions (2006-2013); this process included history-matching to groundwater levels and base-flow estimates at several gages, and was completed in a high-dimensional (highly parameterized) framework. The model was developed in an uncertainty framework such that parameters, observations, and scenarios of interest are envisioned stochastically as distributions of potential values. Results indicate that groundwater contributions to surface water during periods of low flow may be reduced from 6\% to 25\% with a corresponding 25\% reduction in recharge and a 25\% increase in groundwater pumping over an 8-year planning period. Furthermore, results indicate groundwater-level reductions in some hydrostratigraphic units are more likely than in other hydrostratigraphic units over an 8-year period under drought conditions with the higher groundwater withdrawal scenario.},

  abstract={The Vale do Lobo sector of the Campina de Faro aquifer system in the Algarve (Portugal) is at risk of seawater intrusion. Managed Aquifer Recharge (MAR) is being considered to avoid groundwater quality deterioration. Numerical modelling was undertaken to assess the feasibility of several proposed MAR schemes. Although some data is available, many aspects of system behaviour are not well understood or measured. We demonstrate the use of a structurally simple but parametrically complex model for decision-making in a coastal aquifer. Modelling was designed to facilitate uncertainty reduction through data assimilation where possible, whilst acknowledging that which remains unknown elsewhere. Open-source software was employed throughout, and the workflow was scripted (reproducible). The model was designed to be fast-running (rapid) and numerically stable to facilitate data assimilation and represent prediction-pertinent uncertainty (robust). Omitting physical processes and structural detail constrains the type of predictions that can be made. This was addressed by assessing the effectiveness of MAR at maintaining the fresh-seawater interface (approximated using the Ghyben-Herzberg relationship) below specified thresholds. This enabled the use of a constant-density model, rather than attempting to explicitly simulating the interaction between fresh and seawater. Although predictive uncertainty may be increased, it is outweighed by the ability to extract information from the available data. Results show that, due to the limit on water availability and the continued groundwater extraction at unsustainable rates, only limited improvements in hydraulic heads can be achieved with the proposed MAR schemes. This is an important finding for decision-makers, as it indicates that a considerable reduction in extraction in addition to MAR will be required. Our approach identified these limitations, avoiding the need for further data collection, and demonstrating the value of purposeful model design.}

  abstract = {The potential of digital agriculture to support on-farm decision making is predicated on the assumption that ‘cause-and-effect’ relationships can be encoded in a mathematical form. One particularly important application area is irrigation decision making, which is informed by the relationship between applied water and end-of-season crop yield (‘water production relations’). Yet this relationship is often partial, owing to its many determining factors, especially for woody perennial crops such as grapevines. Process-based models are a way in which to represent these relationships in a manner that is both interpretable and generalizable. Here we conduct numerical experiments using a process-based crop model to evaluate water production relations for grapevines and how these relations are influenced by genetic and environmental factors as well as irrigation timing decisions. A real-world case study representing a Shiraz vineyard in South Australia is considered. Results show a largely linear relation between total irrigation applied and yield across all numerical experiments, notwithstanding significant uncertainty due to genetic and environmental factors. However, when considering water production relations in relative terms (e.g., change in tonnes per megalitre), the influence of these factors between seasons is reduced, allowing for more robust insights. Exploration of water productivity as a function of phenological stage shows that the average production sensitivity is greatest during veraison (3.5 tonnes per megalitre) and least between bud burst and flowering (2.3 tonnes per megalitre), despite considerable overlap in productivity range between stages. By putting meaningful bounds on water production relations through process-based modeling, growers and their advisors can achieve improved farm outcomes by better informed water application decisions.}
