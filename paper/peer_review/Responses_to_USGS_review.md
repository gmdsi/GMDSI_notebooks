# Responses to USGS-selected Peer Review by Kalle Jahn
We are repeating all comments in normal type with our repsonses in _italics_.


## General comments
- Overall, this is a great presentation/summary of the notebooks and their utility, and I think the evaluation of them as a teaching tool is well done. Would be great to gather more data on that in the future!  
_Thanks! We do hope to gather more data on future offerings._  
- Although the first paragraph of intro needs a little work, the rest of the intro does a great job of highlighting the issue that these notebooks help address.  
_Thanks for the comment - we revised in response to your specific comments._  
- There are a few locations where there are double spaces between sentences. Those should probably be changed to single?  
_fixed_  
- It's good that you provide the context of how the notebooks might likely be used, like lines 191-200.  
_Awesome - we really wanted this work to be useable._  

## Line-specific comments/suggestions

- 12: double space after "...parts."  
_We went through and fixed all the extra spaces._  
- 17: Unclear what "Their" refers to here. Switch to "The tutorials aim to provide..."?  
_Revised as suggested._  
- 24-26: This first sentence is a bit dense, feels jargony. Because this is the first sentence of the article, I recommend simplifying language a little bit.  
_Reworded in more plain language._  
- 28: "widely acknowledged." I agree, but citation needed?  
_Added a citation._  
- 29: "assimilating data" might need to be explained a bit more. Reader might not know what "assimilation" means in this context.  
_Added a little definition at the end of the sentence._  
- 43: "use" instead of "uptake"?  
_We like "uptake" :)._  
- 51: replace "can be manipulated using text files" with "text files as inputs"  
_Changed - good simplification._  
- 52: replace "that can be automatically extracted" with "are machine-readable"  
_We added "machine-readable" and removed "automatically"._  
- 76: Could also mention that many GUIs are not open-source, reducing accessiblity to those who can afford.  
_Good point - added._  
- 88: Is this true? I would tend to believe. Are anecdotal thoughts okay for this article? I think removing this sentence could be done, starting instead with the sentence on line 89 and replacing "this approach" with "Python packages like FloPy and pyEMU for model and PEST++ setup"  
_We can add that it's "anecdotal" - it def seems true anecdotally, but we don't have evidence._  
- 94: first use of USGS, write out.  
_done_  
- 95: "power of jupyter notebooks" I think Jupyter is capitalized, and you maybe should explain what notebooks facilitate (code and explainations together). And cite Jupyter?  
_All accepted._  
- 98: first time mentioning MATLAB and R, are they discussed in the GMDSI notebooks? If not, I think you could remove.  
_We don't want to imply python is the only game in town.....even though it's the one we focus on._
- 112: This connects to my comment for line 95, I think you need to be more clear right away on what makes the notebooks so useful.  
_We made these points around line 95 according to your previous comment._  
- 134: no hyphen in GitHub  
_Fixed._  
- 144: "visualizations" maybe?  
_We left this one as is._  
- 146: the use of dashes for the list folowing the colon is confusing, I thought something was missing. Were these supposed to be bulleted? If not, then I would recommend something other than dashes if it's going to be a long list as shown.   
_They were meant to be bulleted. We fixed._ 
- 160: are these also supposed to be bullets?  
_fixed._  
- 181: same comment as above  
_fixed._  
- 209: Love the Discussions! maybe highlight that this can continue to be used well after the "experience"?  
_Added some words to highlight that._ 
- 212: figure link broken?  
_Yes. Fixed._  
- 230: This could be a good place to mention that the GitHub Discussions can serve as a virtual version of the in-person discussions/questions?  
_We think we adequately covered this in response to your previous question._  
- 238: missing "." after "U.S"  
_Actually, dropped the first "." to be US Geol....._
