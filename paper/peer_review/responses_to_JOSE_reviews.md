Thank you @incsanchezro for your comprehensive review. Please see below replies and updates.

Kind regards,
-R

> **Comments:**
> 1. The authors have articulated the need for this educational framework, targeting the environmental modellers and decision-makers as specific audiences that could benefit from its implementation. The framework's usage and installation instructions are detailed. 

Appreciated.

> 2. A comprehensive workflow is recommended for the written and framework documentation. This addition should clearly outline the self-learning process, including learning objectives, module prerequisites, and potential implementations. It should make it easier for users to navigate the software autonomously or for educators to integrate it into their teaching methodologies, provided they possess the necessary expertise.

We appreciate the suggestion and agree in principle. We had purposefully left it open ended, as as we tend to find that most users have unique issues that result in each taking their own path. 

Nevertheless, we have added learning objectives and prerequisites in the "Contents and Instructional Design" section of the manuscript and to the README. Furthermore we have included an "example workflow" schematic outline. 

We feel that the existing "workflow" outlined in the [README](https://github.com/gmdsi/GMDSI_notebooks/tree/jose-review#organization-of-the-tutorial-notebooks) provides sufficient guidance to the self-learning process. Furthermore, each of the Notebooks has an introductory section where the learning objectives are usually outlined, along with how these are related to real-world applications.

> 3. The repository's current documentation needs specific guidelines for community involvement in the module's collaborative development. This oversight could be rectified by establishing clear pathways for third-party contributions, issue reporting, and support-seeking, fostering a more engaged and supportive community around the framework.

We have included a "Contributing" section in the README. See commit https://github.com/gmdsi/GMDSI_notebooks/commit/bf5229a4884892a2b9af1e1f018ddde87e66e1d7

> 4. Additionally, clarifying the project's funding sources and outlining strategies for its long-term sustainability would provide further transparency and confidence in the framework's continued evolution and support.

Funding and support for the project is described in the Acknowledgements section of the README. See https://github.com/gmdsi/GMDSI_notebooks#acknowledgments

> 1. While the educational modules provide valuable information, the learning objectives across > all sections need to be explicitly stated.

This clarity will significantly enhance learners' ability to align their > expectations with the module's demands.

We appreciate the suggestion and agree in principle. See response to https://github.com/openjournals/jose-reviews/issues/244

> 2. The framework's current presentation on decision-making within the context of environmental > modelling requires clarity. The authors should further elaborate on their methodology and > precisely define what is encompassed by 'decision-making' in this specialized field. Such > clarification would give learners a more coherent understanding of the module's objectives > and applications.

We have added clarifying text to the Statement of Need section of the paper.

> 3. Furthermore, expanding the authors' pedagogical strategies regarding the support of learners > through the "how to use" and "how to think" processes could further enrich the learning > experience. I suggest amplification of these two elements in the written document and > specific activities into the modules that provide opportunities for the acquisition of skills > and knowledge.

We feel this is already accomplished organically within the Notebooks. Each of these go through the steps of "how to implement" whilst discussing the implications of the choices made, whilst demonstrating and discussing alternative approaches.

> 4. The use of Notebooks as a medium for the framework is highly commendable. It presents a > user-friendly interface that simplifies the learning process and makes the content more > accessible. This choice effectively reduces the cognitive load, making the framework easier > to follow and engage with. The notebooks are generally well-documented, with only minor typos > affecting the overall quality.

Appreciated.

> Your paper draft is insightful and engaging. I appreciate your effort in presenting the story behind the repository! Below, you can find some specific comments that you can use to strengthen the paper's theoretical framework and ensure further references.

> 1. The draft of the paper presents a collaborative endeavour by including a comprehensive list of authors and their affiliations. While the statement of need is both clear and compelling. I suggest a further literature review that solidifies the work's relevance and application. This would enhance the identification of the target audience and the framework's educational significance, thereby strengthening its foundation.

We have included a more comprehensive literature review providing examples of real-world applications and relevance of the tools and techniques presented in the Notebooks.


> 2. The description of the learning materials and their sequence is good. I suggest the addition of a comprehensive workflow. This workflow could outline the self-learning process, incorporating learning objectives, prerequisites for each module, and potential implementations. Such enhancements aim to provide a more robust structure for engagement and understanding among educators and learners alike.

We appreciate the suggestion and agree in principle. See response to https://github.com/openjournals/jose-reviews/issues/244

> 3. Additionally, the endeavour to gather student software feedback is recognized as valuable. Yet, the methodology for capturing this feedback invites improvement to ensure rigour. Recommendations include diversifying the focus groups beyond graduate students to encompass instructors and stakeholders (target audience) and enhancing data collection methods for more effective feedback on the tool's usability.

We appreciate the feedback. We will endeavour to do so in the future.

> 4. The narrative of the paper effectively conveys the story of the framework's development and the authors' expertise, enriching the content with a personal touch that underscores the project's depth. The diligent citation of all archival references, complete with DOIs for papers, datasets, and software, exemplifies a rigorous adherence to academic standards. Such meticulous attention to detail further asserts the module's integrity, credibility, and invaluable role as a teaching and learning resource.

Appreciated.
