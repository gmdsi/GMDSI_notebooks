# Summary

The [GMDSI tutorial notebooks repository](https://github.com/gmdsi/GMDSI_notebooks/tree/main) provides learners with a comprehensive set of tutorials for self-guided training on decision-support groundwater modelling using Python-based tools. Although targeted at groundwater modelling, they are based around model-agnostic tools and readily transferable to other environmental modelling workflows. The tutorials are divided into three parts. The first covers fundamental theoretical concepts. These are intended as background reading for reference on an as-needed basis. Tutorials in the second part introduce learners to some of the core concepts parameter estimation in a groundwater modelling context, as well as providing a gentle introduction to the ``PEST``, ``PEST++`` and ``pyEMU`` software. Lastly, the third part demonstrates how to implement highly-parameterized applied decision-support modelling workflows. The tutorials aim to provide examples of both “how to use” the software as well as “how to think” about using the software. 
A key advantage to using notebooks in this context is that the workflows described run the same code as practitioners would run on a large-scale real-world application. Using a small synthetic model facilitates rapid progression through the workflow.

# Statement of Need

Effective environmental management is often aided by using models. Such models face the challenges of limited data and the inherent simplifications of the complex natural world necessary to make them. This translates to uncertainties in critical decision-making predictions. Transparency is critical in reporting and mitigating these uncertainties, especially when significant risks accompany management outcomes. The significance of uncertainty quantification (UQ) and parameter estimation (PE) in environmental modeling for decision support is widely acknowledged [@Anderson2015]. UQ provides estimates of outcome uncertainty, while PE reduces this uncertainty through assimilating data, using a formal comparison of model outputs with observation data to inform model parameter values. 

Implementing highly-parameterized UQ and PE in real-world modeling can be challenging due to both theoretical complexity and practical logistics. Limited project time and funding also often hinder their application. Open-source software such as ``PEST`` [@pest] and ``PEST++`` [@whitepestpp] provide tools for undertaking UQ and PE analyses. However, the steep learning curve associated with their use and the lack of user-friendly training materials have been a barrier to uptake.

There is a growing demand within the environmental modelling community for transparent, reproducible, and accountable modeling processes, driven by the need for increased credibility and rigor in computational science and environmental simulation [@white11rapid; @fienen2016hess]. While some script-based tools enhance the reproducibility of forward model construction [@flopy], they often overlook UQ and PE analyses. In decision-support scenarios, these analyses are equally vital for robust model deployment as the forward model itself. 

The uptake of Python for environmental modeling has increased in recent years, due to its open-source nature, user-friendly syntax, and extensive scientific libraries. Python-based tools have been developed to facilitate UQ and PE analyses, such as ``pyEMU`` [@White_A_python_framework_2016; @white2021towards]. ``pyEMU`` is a Python package that provides a framework for implementing UQ and PE analyses with PEST and PEST++. It offers a range of capabilities, including parameter estimation, uncertainty analysis, and management optimization. Although initially designed for groundwater modeling, ``pyEMU``'s methodologies are versatile and can be applied to diverse numerical environmental models, as long as they use text files for input and generate machine-readable outputs that can be extracted without manual interference.

The tutorial notebooks discussed herein provide a comprehensive, self-guided, and open-source resource for learning decision-support modeling workflows with Python. They are designed to be accessible to a broad audience, including students, researchers, and practitioners who aim to undertake applied environmental decision-support modelling. 


# Story of the Project

The Groundwater Modelling Decision Support Initiative ([GMDSI](https://gmdsi.org)) is an industry-backed and industry-aligned initiative. Established in mid-2019, its primary goal is to enhance the role of groundwater modeling in groundwater management, regulatory processes, and decision-making. At the core of GMDSI's mission lies the numerical simulation of groundwater movement and processes. Often, data related to groundwater are limited, leading to uncertainties in simulator predictions. However, despite this uncertainty, decisions must be made, and associated risks must be assessed. Modelling plays a central role in the evaluation of these risks.

GMDSI is dedicated to promoting, facilitating, and providing support for the improved utilization of modeling in decision support processes. Its activities endeavor to elevate the role of groundwater modeling in decision-making processes, recognizing the importance of model partner softwar. for UQ and PE, and offering a range of activities aimed at industry engagement, education, practical examples, research, and software development.


A majority of groundwater modelers typically rely on Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for their modeling needs. However, each GUI has its unique characteristics and varying degrees of compatibility with external software like ``PEST`` and ``PEST++``. Creating educational materials for these GUIs would necessitate tailoring content to each GUI's specific features, obtaining cooperation from the GUI developers themselves and potentially lagging behind the latest developments. Many GUIs are commercial products as well which limits accessibility.

Decision-support modeling often demands capabilities that surpass what current GUIs can offer. For example, many of GMDSI's worked examples rely on custom-designed utilities or the integration of different software components. Currently, a significant portion of users may not have the expertise to independently implement such advanced approaches. Furthermore, the manual preparation of input files for implementing these complex workflows can be time-consuming. Programmatic workflows, such as those facilitated by ``pyEMU``, offer advantages by reducing the time and user input required for setup and execution. This approach is somewhat analogous to the role played by a GUI but offers added flexibility, allowing users to customize and design their own functions and utilities as needed. However, it comes with the drawback of increased potential for user-introduced errors.

Anecdotally, we have seen that more modelers are turning to Python packages like ``FloPy`` and ``pyEMU`` for model and ``PEST++`` setup. Unfortunately, the adoption of this approach is hindered by a steep learning curve primarily due to the scarcity of user-friendly training materials. The [GMDSI tutorial notebooks](https://github.com/gmdsi/GMDSI_notebooks/tree/main) aim to address this gap by providing a comprehensive, self-guided, and open-source resource for learning decision-support modeling workflows with Python.

The roots of the materials making up the tutorial notebooks were from a traditional, week-long classroom course curriculum developed for internal training at the US Geological Survey (USGS) by a subset of the authors of this paper. For this course, the instructors leveraged the power of Jupyter notebooks [@jupyter] as a mechanism to teach both the fundamental background and application of inverse theory.  Jupyter notebooks include the ability to provide interactive code and graphics along with detailed, formatted text making them excellent teaching and narrative tools. High-level mathematical libraries in python (and other high-level languages with easy plotting utilities such as MATLAB and R) provide an opportunity for students to explore linear algebra and statistical modeling principles that underlie the PE and UQ techniques implemented in ``PEST`` and ``PEST++``. Furthermore, the combination of text, code, and graphics provide an interactive platform for mixing theory and applications and, potentially, providing a template for application on real-world applications. The native support for python makes the connection between worked examples and notebooks seamless and has connections with other worked examples [@white2020r3; @White2020DR; @fienen2022risk; https://github.com/doi-usgs/neversink_workflow]

After three iterations of teaching the in-person class, the instructors concluded that the materials and approach were valuable, but came to question the level of retention by students in a 40-hour intensive setting. It is well-documented that without repetition and rapid adoption of new techniques, they can fade quickly from memory [@glaveski2019companies]. As a result, the authors, with support from the GMDSI, endeavored to build on the positive aspects of using Jupyter notebooks and explore alternative teaching environments instead of week-long classes. The first major change was to add sufficient narration and explanation to the notebooks to improve possibilities for self-study. The initial design through in-person instruction was to have the notebooks serve as illustrations to assist in a narrative discussion, so bolstering of the explanatory text was necessary to help them stand alone. The next change was to refactor the organization from a strictly linear progression to the current three-part organization discussed below. This led to a hybrid model of self-study punctuated by discussion and background lectures online. 

# Resources

A webinar hosted by GMDSI introducing the tutorial notebooks can be viewed [here](https://vimeo.com/856752189). During the webinar the authors provided an overview of the notebooks, as well as a demonstration of how to use them and introduced an [online self-guided course](https://gmdsi.org/blog/guided-self-study-course/).

The [GMDSI](https://gmdsi.org) web-page also hosts an extensive range of resource. and educational material on decision support modelling. These include numerous instructional video lectures, webinar recordings, non-programmatic workflow tutorials, as well as worked example reports describing real-world applications. 

Software from the ``PEST`` suite can be downloaded from John Doherty's web page [here](https://www.pesthomepage.org/). The [user manual](https://www.pesthomepage.org/Downloads/PEST%20Manuals/PEST%20Manual.pdf) contains much useful information. The [PEST Book](https://pesthomepage.org/pest-book) is also a great resource for learning about the theory underpinning use of the software.

Software from the ``PEST++`` suite can be accessed from GitHub [repository](https://github.com/usgs/pestpp/tree/master). The [user manual](https://github.com/usgs/pestpp/blob/develop/documentation/pestpp_users_manual.md) contains much useful information, as well as theoretical background to the software. Further theoretical background is available in [@whitepestpp].

# Contents and Instructional Design
The tutorial notebooks are structured into three main parts:

## Part 0: Introductory Background

Part 0 serves as the foundation, providing essential background material. Learners are encouraged to reference notebooks in Part 0 to polish their understanding of concepts they encounter in Parts 1 and 2. Part 0 is not intended to be a comprehensive resource for all background material, but rather to establish a solid understanding of the basics. The explanations of mathematical concepts are intended to be accessible through visualization and descriptions related to everyday concepts and modelling concepts. 

Each notebook in Part 0 is standalone and covers a unique topic. These include:
 * Introduction to a synthetic model known as the "Freyberg" model. This model is used as a consistent example throughout the tutorial exercises, allowing learners to apply concepts in a practical context.
 * An introduction to the `pyemu` Python package that is used to complement and interface with PEST/PEST++.
 * Explanation of fundamental mathematical concepts that are relevant and will be encountered throughout the tutorial notebooks.

Pre-requisites for Part 0 include a basic understanding of Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and MODFLOW 6. Familiarity with git is a bonus but not fundamental.

After completing this module, learners should be able to:
  * Describe the structure and components of the synthetic Freyberg model.
  * Apply the `pyemu` Python package to interface with PEST/PEST++.
  * Discuss the mathematical concepts that underpin the PEST/PEST++ software.

## Part 1: Introduction to PEST and the Gauss-Levenberg Marquardt Approach

Part 1 focuses on the Gauss-Levenberg Marquardt (GLM) approach to parameter estimation and associated uncertainty analysis in a groundwater modelling context. This was the foundation of the ``PEST`` software for multiple decades and the theory continues to resonate through newer techniques.

Part 1 is designed to be accessible without strict sequential dependencies. Learners have the flexibility to explore its contents in any order that suits their preferences or needs. These include:
 -Introduction to concepts such as non-uniqueness, identifiability, and equifinality.
 -Introduction to the PEST control file and the PEST/PEST++ interface.
 -Exploring the challenges of parameterization schemes on predictive ability, as well as how to mitigate them.
 -Introducing first-order second-moment (FOSM) and prior Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis approaches.

 While Part 1 notebooks can be largely run in any order, the curriculum was initially designed to start with simple parameterization of a model and to build complexity intentionally throughout the progression of the sequence. The ramifications of simplification and the value of adding complexity are evaluated in the context of the performance of the model in forecasts made outside the parameter estimation conditions. This progression motivates the value of a highly-parameterized approach which is the starting point for many new projects, as explored in Part 2.

Pre-requisites for Part 1 include a basic understanding of numerical groundwater modelling and familiarity with MODFLOW 6. Familiarity with Python and Jupyter Notebooks is assumed.

After completing this module, learners should be able to:
 * Describe the GLM approach to parameter estimation.
 * Explain non-uniqueness, identifiability and equifinality in the context of decision-support modelling.
 * Construct a PEST control file and interface files.
 * Understand the effect of parameterization schemes on model predictive ability.
 * Explain the difference between linear and non-linear uncertainy analysis approaches and the value of each.

## Part 2: Python-based Decision-Support Modelling Workflows
Part 2 expands on the foundational knowledge gained in Part 1 and delves into advanced topics related to ensemble-based parameter estimation, uncertainty analysis and optimization methods. These advanced topics include management optimization and sequential data assimilation. This approach and these advanced topics assume a highly-parameterized approach, as motivated in Part 1. Topics are laid out in manner that reflects real-world workflows, with a focus on practical application of concepts and problem solving.

Part 2 is structured with a specific order for learners to follow to ensure a logical progression of topics, inline with a real-world applied workflow. Learners have the option to explore various sequences covering advanced topics, such as:
 * Prior Monte Carlo analysis
 * Highly-parameterized Gauss-Levenberg Marquardt history matching and associated Data Worth analysis using First Order, Second Moment (FOSM) techqnique, 
 * Ensemble-based history matching and uncertainty analysis with the iterative ensemble smoother approach as implemented in ``PEST++IES``, 
 * Sequential data assimilation with ``PEST++DA``, and 
 * Single-objective and multi-objective optimization under uncertainty with ``PEST++OPT`` and ``PEST++MOU``.
 
Each of these sequences comprises multiple notebooks to be executed in a specified order. They demonstrate how to execute the workflow, interpret results, and apply the concepts to real-world problems.

In summary, the tutorial notebooks are organized to guide learners through a structured learning experience in the field of decision-support groundwater modelling. Part 0 provides foundational knowledge, while Parts 1 and 2 offer progressively advanced content. The authors attest that it is ideal to work through Parts 1 and 2 in their entirety, referring back to Part 0 for additional background. However, this amount of content requires a significant time commitment so, practically, many users will start with Part 2 and, hopefully, be able to apply the concepts to a problem of their own as they progress. Over time, referring back through Part 1 will provide a deeper understanding of some concepts and techniques taken for granted in the highly-parameterized, largely ensemble-based approaches of Part 2.

Pre-requisites for Part 2 include a basic understanding of PEST/PEST++ and the PEST interface, as well as familiarity with the Freyberg model. Familiarity with Python and Jupyter Notebooks is assumed.

After completing this module, learners should be able to:
 * Construct a high-dimensional PEST control file and interface files.
 * Implement GLM and ensemble-based parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis workflows using PEST++ and associated tools.
 * Apply management optimization and sequential data assimilation techniques to decision-support groundwater modelling problems.


# Experience of use in teaching and learning situations

The notebooks were employed during the [Applied Decision Support Groundwater Modeling With Python: A Guided Self-Study Course](https://gmdsi.org/blog/guided-self-study-course/) hosted by GMDSI. This self-guided course comprised 5 online sessions, each lasting 1 to 2 hours and focused on the workflows of Part 2. During each session the instructors go through a section of the tutorials and expand on some of the concepts. Learners were tasked with going through the notebooks in between sessions to stimulate discussion and questions. Sessions were recorded and can be accessed [on the GMDSI website](https://gmdsi.org/education/videos/). Beyond the live online sessions, learners were incentivized to make use of the GitHub [Discussions](https://github.com/gmdsi/GMDSI_notebooks/discussions) feature to retain a search-engine findable record of common questions that persist beyond the time-frame of the course and can help address other questions that arise in the community. 

Feedback from the 65 students who participated in the course was anecdotal but informative. \autoref{fig:responses} summarizes the responses by 34 respondents to four questions, comprising 52%. The majority of respondents indicated a preference for this hybrid self-guided/online instruction approach over an in-person week-long intensive class with only one respondent indicating preference for self-guided study of the course materials only. Just under 60% of the respondents reported being able to keep up with most or all of the assigned self-study notebooks, while 41% reported falling behind. Given 5 categories of comfort level working with PEST++ (1 being most comfortable, and 5 being least) before and after the class, there was a notable shift toward higher comfort level. Interestingly, when evaluating individual responses, the majority (56%) reported being more comfortable with PEST++ after the course (defined as an increase of one level) and 15% reported being much more comfortable (an increase of two levels). However, 21% reported the same comfort level before and after while 24% reported being less or much less comfortable (a decrease or one or two levels, respectively). Without further questions, we cannot know whether these decreases reflect a humble realization that their mastery was less complete than they thought, _a priori_, or whether the material was confounding. 

Open-ended feedback from the participants was generally positive and also included some constructive criticism. Participants appreciated the opportunity to ask questions and several reported hearing the discussion around other peoples' questions as being valuable and clarifying aspects of the material. The main critical suggestions included incorporating more real-world examples rather than relying, as we 100% did in the notebook design, on the synthetic model. Participants also noted the twin challenges of a large amount of information coupled with trying to be accountable to keep up in the class as potentially limiting the value relative to a week-long course. We conclude from this experience that the hybrid approach has value but there may still be a better approach for future educational opportunities.
